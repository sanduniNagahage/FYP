418,A Day Spent Waiting
419,"Today , I wasted a lot of time waiting ."
420,I waited the entire morning for my company 's car to help me deliver a shelf to my customer and also waited for my customer to put the shelf in the supermarket the whole afternoon .

425,"its 9 : 30 in the morning here , , instead of taking milk and breakfast first , , I opened first my computer hahaha . . . word order"
426,These are serious problems .
427,"In Hong Kong , the government focuses on the drug problem ."
428,"Also , Many social workers are concerned about the family and violence problems ."
429,"However , there are no programs to deal with young people 's sexual behaviour ."
430,But why has this issue in recent years been even more serious ?
431,"The researchers note that `` If women are exposed to abuse , domestic violence , and family strife , it has enduring effects . ``"
432,Also there are many cases which teenagers give up their babies in the street or have an abortion .
433,"The most important thing is , they do not think they are wrong ."
434,She wrote a diary and posted her pregnancy photos on the Internet .
435,She was proud of her pregnancy .
436,We have three kinds of solutions to solve the teenage pregnancy problem .
437,The second one is non - government and social workers . The last one is consulting with other countries ' policies .
438,"Firstly , government should invest more in sex education ."
439,"Also , teenagers feel embarrassed communicating with their teachers and parents ."
440,Their peer group also affects them .
441,"For example , their peer group may give them the wrong messages regarding & nbsp ; sex ."
442,Teenagers may misunderstand issues regarding sex when they receive incorrect information from their & nbsp ; peer group .
443,They are curious about sex and want to try it .
444,Sex education reduces the rate of teenage pregnancy .
445,Teachers can take care of teenagers when teaching them safe sex .
446,"Also , it can reduce their curiosity and let them learn the the correct values ."
447,"Moreover , mass media gives unsuitable messages to young people . For example , Mother at 14 ( television drama ) , My Guardian Characters ( children 's comic book ) , and Juno ( Film ) provide & nbsp ; negative messages ."
448,"They may think teenage pregnancy is a universal phenomenon and part of & nbsp ; Western culture , or that & nbsp ; it is not a problem and not special ."
449,"Also , it can be perceived as a trend to follow ."
450,"So , the Hong Kong government should set up the law so & nbsp ; as to supervise the mass media ."
451,I do n't need to use English in daily life .
452,"I do n't have a strong reason to study English ,"

498,"I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy .

532,m and sleep till 1 p . m .
533,The new semester will start next week and some of my classes will begin at 11 a . m .
534,It 's a shame to let them pass me by because of oversleeping .
535,So I have been waking up at 8 a .
536,"It 's not easy for me to wake up early and sometimes I feel an irrestitible urge to sleep during the day , but still I manage to get out of bed by at least 8 a ."
537,I have an appointment to meet my boss at my new job tomorrow a bit late at night .
538,I will fight to keep myself awake tomorrow ! !
539,The package included an electronic dictionary that I borrowed from her a long time ago .
540,"I had forgotten to return it , but she suddenly called me and asked for it to be returned ."
541,So I found it in my desk and she sent it with some souvenirs .
542,I called my mom and let her know it was sent by my wife this morning .
543,"After I finished my work , I met a friend who is member of the same English circle ."
544,She has a lot of DVDs which at last count was over 200 !
545,I introduced her to Lang - 8 .
546,I said it was good for studying .
547,Then we went for a little drink and had a good time talking .
548,She said she wanted to begin studying an English radio program .
549,So we will study the same program and compare what we learnt every week .
550,It started raining just as I got home by bicycle .
551,"Yesterday , I bought a great deal of ripened tomatoes ."
552,"I should or , actually , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there 's always some stuff that catches my attention more than studying ."
553,What is Happiness ? Part 2
554,"While I was listening to her story , I was looking at my dinner that had already became cold ."
555,Both of us were n't eating .
556,She sometimes expressed her tears and sighed .
557,"Actually , I listened to her since I could n't encourage her ."
558,"However , I listened to her story silently ."
559,All I could do was to grip her hands .
560,"To tell you to the truth , I really wanted to hug her , but I could n't because I did n't want to surprise her ."
561,Hugging is n't a part of Japanese culture .
562,That 's life . : (
563,It is cheaper to play now compared with before .
564,"Though the origins of golf are unclear , it seems that shepherds knocking stones into rabbit holes is an established theory ."
565,"If it had been kept that way , it would cost nothing , right ?"
566,"Anyway , I really want to see Tiger play golf ."
567,It is raining hard today .
568,"In Japan , there are a lot of typhoons in September ."
569,I am worried about getting back home .
570,The train will probably have to stop .
571,My interpreter 's class was so tough for me last lesson .
572,The theme was about social participation in Japan .
573,One of my classmates made a presentation about how Japan is struggling and facing tough economic times as well as political issues .
574,"For the past twenty years , specially middle - aged men in particular have had many abilities and privileges ."
575,They could control all of Japan .
576,However they do n't have enough abilities and publicity now .
577,"So , we need to get a second wind ."
578,"In the future more people who are women , non - residence and youth should participate in any social movements ."
579,It should be better than now .
580,That theme felt abstract for me .
581,I thought she should have focused more on the concrete details .
582,"We are , naturally , always looking for the best method , the fastest way , the easiest path to mastering English , Japanese , Spanish , whateverish . . ."
583,"On the other hand , good methods [ Assimil ? ] when used wrong can produce poor results ."
584,"In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] notice by yourself is that there is n't A SINGLE METHOD for language learning ."
585,"Each student has to find his own method , his own way of learning ."
586,"Of course , this is n't an easy thing to do ."
587,"I know some things work and some do n't , but to find out exactly how to do it is n't that easy ."
588,"All methods have good and bad points , so what you have to do is notice the good points and use them in your own way ."
589,"Of course I 'm being a bit theatrical , but I just want to show that there is n't one method that rules over all others ."
590,"If you work hard on it , you probably will not only find out which learning methods and strategies suit you better , but you also will start to notice some universal principles about language learning ."
591,"The average language learner , who usually follows just one methods ( like many English teachers here in Brazil who have taught English using the same method for more than 20 years ) , will probably not learn these principles and , therefore , become kind of limited when it comes to how to learn a language ."
592,We had a very good time playing a chasing game in the water .
593,I 'm very happy to see that my daughter started to have more confidence in the water because she could n't put her face in the water before she went to swimming lessons .
594,She was even scared of getting a splash on her face when she had a shower .
595,Now she can do a headstand in the water !
596,"As her school will have swimming lessons starting soon , hopefully she will have no problem in the water and can enjoy swimming with others ."
597,I can tell the chlorine in the pool was very strong since a splash of the water hurt my eyes quite a bit .
598,"In addition to that , I felt really tired after getting out of the water although I had n't swum much ."
599,It is already December .
600,Did you enjoy every day so far ?
601,"If you go , you will not regret it ."
602,Study More English
603,"I want to know more English words , and I look words up with a dictionary ."
604,"I do n't know many English words and grammar and idioms and culture , etc . , , , , , I have no choice but to study English every day ."
605,That 's why I have to go to Canada . I want to go there ! ! !
606,"So , I dooooooo n't give up ! ! !"

742,"I 'm a student of the department of history . However , I must learn more than that . Such as international relations , English , and Japanese ."
743,"Everyday , I study those four aspects from 7 : 00 to 22 : 00 ."
744,And I always have no time to do any others .
745,someone told me I must speak English very well .
746,"I need friend and I need people to be content with me . However , people do n't like me . Atleast this is what I think ."
747,who can help me or tell me what can I do ?
748,My Anxiety
749,He had secretly smoked with his friends .
750,His teacher came to our house .
751,He told me what had happened .
752,This is the first time that I have heard of their misbehavior .
753,I thought my son wanted to escape from being forced to study by me .
754,"I reflected on myself a lot and said to him ,"
755,"`` You do not have to study so much , so you should stay home . ``"
756,I have heard the sound of them walking on the roof .
757,One day I heard a voice in his room so I opened the door to his room .
758,"Then , I saw two boys hiding behind the bunk bed ."
759,I asserted to them about a few things .
760,I am sorry that you do not keep the promises you made with me about not smoking and studying harder .
761,What should I do ?
762,This is my first time to use this site .
763,So I would like to communicate with whoever wants to ( speak with me ) .
764,I tend to believe in ghosts because I was born in small town .
765,The population of my town was low .
766,My neighbor 's house was old so it was easily broken when a typhoon comes to our region .
767,"Before I tried to sleep at night , I always went to the restroom where I can see their house ."
768,I could n't do anything because I was a kid .
769,"I called my mom : `` Hey , I found a cockroach so please kill them . ``"
770,`` com ' on mom ! ``
771,`` hurry up ! ``
772,I often used something like that .
773,My high school years ( 4 )
774,They entertained me nearly through all of grade 2 .
775,"Of course , I was worried about my behavior when I was found enjoying them ."
776,They finally found out .
777,I was suspended to make a self - examination . ?
778,"At the beginning , though , I found that I could not catch up with my lessons , for I had missed so many lessons ."
779,"Because of this , it took me four years to finish the three - year junior high school ."
780,She likes the new hospital because the doctor explains to her well .
781,It 's at a very easy level .
782,I heard it 's good to read many books in a suitable level .
783,"Now , the number of words I can read is 2666 words ."
784,5th generation iPod nano
785,I bought a 5th generation iPod nano last December .
786,So it is not easy for me to use Apple products .
787,I can import music into my iPod nano but ca n't understand the way to import any pictures .
788,"Finally , today , I found out how to import some pictures into it !"
789,I am very happy about being able to do that .
790,"I had a very busy day today . I had two classes , checked students ' notebooks and there was a business trip ."
791,"I was going to go to conversational English class , but the English teacher caught a cold yesterday , so today 's lesson was canceled ."
792,"I went to a Mexican restaurant , `` El Torito `` tonight and ate Enchilada , Salsa chips , Ceaser salad , and ice cream and drank a Margarita which was frozen with a salt fringe around the glass ."

794,There are many tv screens hanging on the wall and the tv channel is always sports channel `` ESPN . `` Today 's sport was baseball .

797,Today is Guy Fawkes Night ( or bonfire night ) in Oxford .
798,"Although it is officially the fifth of November , the event is to be held Saturday night this year ."
799,Last year my wife and I went to the bonfire held at South Park .
800,"Although it was a cold night , the large park was full of people ."
801,"Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Parliament in order to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland , but failed and was arrested on the fifth of November in 1605 ."
802,The failed assassination attempt is now known as the gunpowder plot .
803,"For some reason , the British have been celebrating this day with a bonfire and fireworks for more than 400 years ."
804,I 'm not even sure that the British are in favour of or are against Guy Fawkes himself and his plot .
805,"In my opinion , most of them may be taking advantage of his failed attempt as a reason / excuse to enjoy fireworks ."
806,"For me as a Japanese , fireworks on a cold autumn night are very unusual and is quite a surreal experience , since fireworks are icons of the hottest summer season in Japan , reminding me the humidity and hot air , girls wearing yukata ( by the way , girls with yukata look 30 % more attractive and prettier than usual ) , kakigori ( crushed ice with fruit - flavoured syrup ) , and so on ."
807,"When a British `` guy `` visits Japan and see fireworks festivals in summer , what would he think / how would he feel ?"
808,Drowsiness
809,"I stayed up all night last night , and so I am terribly sleepy today ."
810,"However , I do it anyway ."
811,"Because drowsiness harms study , it is necessary to take care ."

816,Packers v . s . Falcons
817,One of the division play - offs is `` Packers v . s . Falcons `` .
818,The Falcons have beaten the Packers this season .
819,This clip tells me that the next game will be too close to call .
820,"This movie 's origin is the graphic novel `` WATCHMEN `` , written by Alan Moore , illustrated by Dave Gibbons ."
821,"I can say , `` WATCHMEN `` challenges the reader 's mind ."
822,What is evil ?
823,What is justice ?
824,What is humanity ?
825,We can be allowed to sacrifice someone to save the world ?
826,I 've had no time to write on Lang - 8 .
827,I 'm writing on Lang - 8 for the first time in a month .
828,"I went to Shiga prefecture last week , and stayed at Biwako Hotel beside a lake ."
829,"At night , I watched the harvest moon ."
830,I completely forgot about a lot of work .
831,Then he begins climbing the stairs .
832,I study English almost every day .
833,But I 'm not good at English .
834,"Therefore , I want to learn to read , write and speak English ."
835,"By the way , I have a Twitter account ."
836,I went out to a Yakitori restaurant with my collegue after work last night .
837,"It was so hot during the day , so I wanted to go to a restaurant in which air conditioning works ."
838,"When we stood in front of the door of that restaurant , we found the door was open ."
839,I had a feeling that what I did n't hope for would now happen .
840,Due to the hot atmosphere I could drink much more beer .
841,I felt more comfortable as wind sometimes blew into the restaurant .
842,"As you might know , the Yakitori is a popular Japanese food ."
843,"It is made from several bite - sized pieces of chicken meat , or chicken offal , skewered on a Bamboo skewer and barbecued ."
844,"It is served with salt or with `` Tare `` sauce , which is generally made up of mirin , sake , soy sauce and sugar ."
845,Yesterday I went to a famous fortune teller .
846,She is in Harajuku Tokyo and is called `` Mother of Harajuku `` .
847,"I always inquire about my job , my marriage and my health ."
848,She said that I 'll meet my destined woman next spring ! !
849,I 'm looking forward to meeting her .
850,I just have a question :
851,How do you say TO and FROM in Japanese
852,Or when you give a gift ?
853,I write in my diary on Lang - 8 in English for the first time .
854,"So , I try to write in my diary to learn how to use English ."
855,I write in my diary every day as much as I can / as much as possible .
856,"Today , I went to a restaurant to eat okonomiyaki with my friends ."
857,I could eat as much as I wanted .
858,"However , I ate too much and have a sore stomach ."
859,I 'm studying the immune system now .
860,I will explain about my research in more detail someday .
861,"I passed the qualification exam , `` Eiken , Pre - one grade `` a few months ago ."
862,"applicants , so I think that is why they 're going to hold this sample test ."
863,"In these months , I have not been a diligent student ."
864,I 'm always busy these days !
865,These days I 'm always busy because school has started .
866,"Since school started , I do n't have much time to do anything I want to do ."
867,"Unfortunately , the only thing that I have time for is studying , studying , and more studying ."
868,We are all going crazy now .
869,"This year my teachers are funny . Also , I have joined a modern drama club ."
870,Drama club is funny and exciting .
871,"My new life , is full of happiness and fun times ."
872,But my life is also full of pressure .
873,"So , I need to study hard now ."
874,I bought some stocks last Oct .
875,"Since then , I 've been really interested in economics ."
876,The economics in Japan is easily affecteed by that of foreign countries ( especially US ) .
877,"Of course not only Japan , many countries ' economics are affected by other countries ' economics ."
878,"Now , in my country , many people were fired , and what is worse , it 's difficult for anyone to find new job ."
879,There 's alot of bad news like this now . . .
880,"However , do n't you think the relationship of economics between one country and another is interesting ?"
881,I think it 's still too early for me to talk about economics in English .
882,"Since I 'd like to know about these places as much as possible , I am reading guide books and checking the internet every day ."
883,I Have Become Aware
884,"Recently , I 've become aware that it 's not easy to earn money ."
885,We never earn money at the time of working .
886,Maybe there are some jobs that can get lots of money a day .
887,But I do n't think they are absolutely good jobs .
888,Have a nice day ! !
889,It is a nice weather today !
890,I like such a day .
891,"I had only a class on management today . It was boring ,"
892,It means that the final - exams are coming soon .
893,Maybe I gon na turn crazy . . . . .
894,But I am not in the mood to study . . . . I am so lazy . . . . . .
895,By the way I am about to leave for home
896,Today my college will hold an event ! I think it will be fun !
897,This event is held once a year .
898,I could meet a lot of friends ! I am very excited !
899,This story shall continue later . . . . . . . .
900,I cooked two hamburger dishes yesterday .
901,I was going to play tennis in the afternoon .
902,But what makes these two videos totally different ?
903,"When the sun shines , I will hold your hand and together we will walk along the streets ."
904,Today I 'd like to tell a story about a drunk who lost his keys .
905,"It 's a famous joke , so you may have heard it"
906,I think it is a simple story but it teaches us important lesson about our life .
907,"One night , a man goes out to drink at a local bar ."
908,"After saying goodbye to his friends , he begins walking home , singing happily"
909,"As he is getting close to his apartment , he takes his keys out of his pocket but drops them on the ground in the dark ."
910,"Once he realizes his keys are missing , he wanders around a street lamp and begins looking for them"
911,I had a trouble with my English .
912,Though I have been learning English for a long time .
913,"I knew my problem was that I cound 't catch the meaning what people had said , and my pronunciation was too bad ."
914,"I wanted to be able to master English conversation , but I spent most of the time studying grammar and even I tried to read newspaper and novels ."
915,"All study are helpful , but some of them are not effective ."
916,It is important for me to know what I want and focus on it .
917,Japanese comedians sometimes parody the foreigner 's way of speaking Japanese .
918,"The way they do this is by omitting particles , incorrect accent and intonation and it seems that they can be categorised by nationalities ."
919,I suppose this may be true from my experiences and acutally English children learn nursery rhymes by language acquisition .
920,"Otherwise , if Japanese learners mimicked their rhythm , even if it was strange Japanese , they might obtain the skill to speak naturally ."
921,Junzo Kawada is a researcher in cultural anthropology and he went to Africa to research a tribe whose language does not have letters .
922,He claimed that they use their imagination to convey to their drums .
923,"When I listened to this story , I thought this is like typing to a keyboard ."
924,Because there are rhythm patterns when you hit the keyboard .
925,It takes about a minute to go the station . ( by foot ? )
926,"I 'm going to commute , by subway , to my office which is in Liu Jia Zui ."
927,I have to transfer to `` line two `` at Jing An Si station .

929,I drink coffee everyday .

931,This is a chocolate flavored coffee .
932,Because it tastes very bitter .
933,What type of coffee do you like ?
934,Laptops make people lazy .
935,I hate to use the laptop because it makes me lazy .
936,"I use the laptop on my bed , I surf the internet , and finally I watch dramas . . ."
937,"it makes me NOT STUDY , and NOT EXERCISE !"
938,I worked until late tonight .
939,I 'm very tired and ( very ) sleepy .
940,What are the most popular English websites ?
941,Which of them are the majority of Englishmen / Americans visiting every day ?
942,"The best would be those with interesting contents , news , or sites about science , computer science etc ."
943,I want to improve my ability to write in English .
944,I finished my work a little earlier than usual and bought a birthday cake for her on the way back home .
945,Our oldest son had a headache during the daytime .
946,"Today , I read a magazine about environment ."
947,The magazine is NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC .
948,I was impressed by an article written about jet man .
949,"He flew by jet engine , which made the man a bird ."
950,so he was called Bird man .
951,"I think that the human dream is to fly in the sky , and I envy him ."
952,I ate KAKIAGE - UDON for lunch .
953,"KAKIAGE is a Japanese deep - fried food , which includes some vegetables such as carrot , onion etc ."

963,I got on the bus .
964,"After I sat down , I checked my wallet ."
965,Oh my god !
966,"I had a bill of five thousand yen , but I did n't have anychange ."
967,The fare of the bus was 220 yen .
968,"On most Japanease buses , you ca n't get change ."
969,He said he did n't have any change .
970,I asked him what should I do .
971,"He said I could go without paying the fare , but next time I get on the bus I you should tell the driver this story , and pay the fare then ."
972,"I thanked him , and got off the bus ."
973,On the way home from the bus stop I got soaking wet .
974,"Hi everyone , nice to meet you ."
975,"Because Gunma is not a famous like Tokyo , and Kiryu is in that prefecture 's countryside ."
976,I had to pay for electricity and Internet .
977,"In Tanzania , almost everything is an advance payment system while everything is a later payment in Korea ."
978,"Here , I use a prepaid electricity system called LUKU ."
979,I have to buy voucher first if I want to use electricity .
980,( I 'm not sure whether voucha is an English word or not . ) ( voucher is correct )
981,in case of mobile phone and Internet and so on . . . . .
982,I could n't use internet during last weekend beause my internet valid period was over on last Friday .
983,"Thus , I had to go to town today ."
984,I bought some fruit and a bottle of wine on my way to town .
985,I also bought a wine glass to drink / for drinking wine .
986,I drank a glass of wine and I felt so good .
987,I may look like an alcoholic : - (
988,"We have a good time there , because our house is bigger than our old house that we lived in a month ago ."
989,"It is not national a sport ,"
990,but we can watch every match on NHK national TV broadcast .
991,"In Japan , sumo matches are held 6 times per year ."
992,"The festivals on odd number months are held in tokyo ,"
993,and even one 's are in other areas such as Osaka Naoya and Kyusyu .
994,"last Sunday , the festival in Osaka began ."
995,It is called `` Haru - basyo `` which means spring season .
996,"Recently , we can see foreign sumo wrestlers , especially from mongolia ."
997,"If he wins the championship this season , he will be selected as `` Ozeki `` ."

1005,What is the difference between `` can `` and `` kin `` ?
1006,Today 's Work
1007,I have to make a document by Friday .
1008,I finished making the document today .
1009,Me and my staff visited one client and had a meeting with them .
1010,"In that meeting , there was a hard negotiation between us and the client ."
1011,We discussed about how to operate this deal .
1012,"Finally , we set the date of our next meeting and agreed on our next points to discuss ."
1013,Pollen is blowing everywhere .
1014,It becomes warm and confortable to go outside .
1015,Pollen gives me hayfever .
1016,"When I was looking up the word ' agitate ' in dictionary , I found an example which confused me ."
1017,A big mosquito has bitten me !
1018,There 's a mosquito in my room .
1019,It looks very big .
1020,He already bit me a couple times when I was taking a nap .
1021,I do n't want him to live all night long . . .
1022,My friend who is Japanese can listen carefully thier sound and then he can tell if they are male or female .
1023,"I think that if they are male , they do n't want ( to bite me / my blood ) ."
1024,I ca n't do the same as my friend .
1025,But I think the mosquito in my room is female .
1026,Because it bit me in two places .
1027,I am itchy now . . . .
1028,"On our project meeting , we talk about what each person trying next week ."
1029,"Anyway , we have kind of a strange custom for christmas ."
1030,Eating KFC chicken is one of the example for our unique custom for christmas .
1031,"My cousin said my diaries always are so short , but I do n't know what I can write in the diary ."
1032,Mosquitoes like this weather .
1033,They fly into the house when someone opens the door .
1034,I am on a train on the way to my university .
1035,"Whenever I 'm on a train , I observe people in there , especially those who are on the opposite seat from where I 'm sitting ."
1036,"About 10 people can sit down on the seat , but I can see 5 people at first sight ."
1037,"Now , three girls are playing with their mobiles and two old guys are sleeping ."
1038,"Ah , the train arrived at the station , so I have to change trains ."
1039,"As I wrote on this diary on November 4th , one of our managers gave a lecture on cost management ."
1040,The measure to deal with the falling birthrate
1041,DPJ 's main policy to combat the falling birthrate is by giving 26000yen per child per month to parents .
1042,I think that it 's not enough and not a good policy .
1043,"I read an economist opinion in the paper that said `` Big companies should set up day - care centers for children . `` The same paper said that Itochu , a famous trading company , set up a day - care center ."
1044,"According to the article , Mitsui Bussan and Sumitomo Shoji , which are also famous trading companies , already have their day - care centers ."
1045,"I think & nbsp ; that companies having their own day - care center is very good idea , and a very good measure to address the falling birthrate ."
1046,Most of the fathers or mothers would go to day - care centers on their way to the office and they take more time for commuting .
1047,But if their company has a day - care center they can go to their office with their children without time consuming detours .
1048,"If a day - care center is near their office , they can easily go there to watch their child 's life ."
1049,So I wish many more companies would set up their own day - care centers near their office and many people can easily have both a career and children .
1050,I will start my diary .
1051,"Recently , It has been very hot ! !"
1052,then I tried to sleep again .
1053,It was too tiring to do in the morning .
1054,I 'm working at admission center of a university in Japan .
1055,"I do n't like office work , but my colleagues are very funny ."
1056,so I can keep on working there .
1057,Our boss gives us ice cream sometimes .
1058,but I have decided to go abroad or take part in working holiday next year .
1059,that ` s it for today .
1060,I have to study English more .
1061,"If you go and look at the moon , it appears to move with you ."
1062,"And , if you 'll look at it carefully , you might notice that it has a human 's face : a nose , raised eyebrows , a lovely smile . . ."
1063,"One dark night , Ira Dmitrieva was coming home , but the moon 's smile was n't lovely for her ."
1064,"On the contrary , the moon seemed to tell her : `` You 'll see how you will be met at home ."
1065,`` It 's very late . ``
1066,Ira looked at the ground and thought : `` If only my parents were sleeping ! ``
1067,"She wanted to blame someone , but she knew that she could n't ."
1068,Ira looked quickly at the windows of her flat on the fifth floor .
1069,"Much to Ira 's dismay , there was a light on inside ."
1070,`` What should I tell them ?
1071,Ira remembered how her mom 's voice sounded when she was angry .
1072,Ira was very scared .
1073,"I watched a movie called , `` Broken English `` alone yesterday ."
1074,I got a day off suddenly and I wondered what I would do .
1075,"Eventually , I watched it but it was really boring ."
1076,It was about a lady who falls in love with a French man .
1077,"I thought he could n't speak English fluently which was the reason of the title , but he could ."
1078,"He only made one mistake , and it was mixing up angry and hungry ."
1079,"He said he was hungry , but she realized that he was angry ."
1080,It was really funny because his English was really fluent .
1081,"I have finished two line drawing ( handmade sketches on paper ) , I am going to color it in class tomorrow , so teacher could correct me simultaneously ."
1082,she went to see a doctor in a big hospital .
1083,"And yesterday , she came back with the result ."
1084,The result of the blood test and CT scan were all normal .
1085,"Actually , she had terrible constipation . . . ."
1086,Because of my doubts I researched something about this topic on the internet and I discovered that for some people it 's not easy .
1087,but I think this test would last five minutes !
1088,The champions league 's 2nd leg of the quarter finals were held yesterday and today .
1089,"In the quarter finals , Raul , who belongs to Schalke , got the goals in the 1st leg and the 2nd leg , which gave me goose pumps ."
1090,I start ( started ) lang - 8 today .
1091,I 've been thinking about why I want to study English .
1092,And tonight I got a part of the answer .
1093,I have a feeling that it is different from everybody else 's ( reason ) .
1094,But everybody has a reason why they want to study second launguage .
1095,I want to study hard so I can explain my answer .
1096,I was a child when I first watched this movie .
1097,"It was amazing , the story line in particular ."
1098,"In the last scene of this movie , Doc dropped an important cable from the roof of the school many times ."
1099,I almost destroyed the TV in anger .
1100,"I can imagine , after this movie released , many American kids played with skateboards on the road ."
1101,I think the best ways to learn Korean are the same as English .
1102,The best way to practice listening is watching Korean dramas or movies .
1103,I will give you one .
1104,Read out loud even though you do n't understand the meanings .
1105,"Every day , read Korean books out loud , you will eventually master it ."
1106,"If you do n't have a friend to talk to , you can talk to me through skype ."
1107,"Maybe , you can speak in Korean to your family , even though they do n't understand it ."
1108,It is good practice .
1109,I think this is the hardest one .
1110,The best way is to write some things on this website and ask native Koreans to correct them .
1111,"I , actually , hated studying English when I was in high school ."
1112,My College 's Anniversary Celebrations
1113,April 18th is a special day .

1126,I 'm looking forward to getting the vacation .
1127,"I need a certain amount of salary to support my family , however my current salary is not good ."
1128,"So yesterday , I looked at some job hunting websites ."
1129,Do n't ask me `` Why did n't you wait to get married until you had a high paying job ? `` At that time I was very desperate to settle down in Singapore .
1130,"Needless to say , speaking a foreign language like a native speaker is almost impossible for everyone except native bilinguals ."
1131,"But for me , `` business English `` sounds like . . . `` almost perfect English . `` As far as I can see , Such super Japanese workers do n't exist ."
1132,Are there many Japanese people who can speak English like native speakers somewhere in Singapore somewhere that I do n't know yet ?
1133,What the heck is business English ?
1134,"Last night my friend told me about Lang - 8 , and I think it is very good for studying English . ."
1135,I wish to make friends with you guys . . .
1136,Today is a beautiful and sunny Saturday !
1137,I usually spend my weekends going shopping or doing exercises or just relaxing .
1138,I always think that keeping an English diary is a good way to practice my English skills .
1139,"But , unfortunately , I somehow did n't do it ."
1140,"Therefore , I chose to join Lang - 8 !"
1141,It has been 1 year since I came to the U . S .
1142,"But even though my English h [ / BLUE ] as not improved , one thing that I have felt is that I am not afraid of using English any more , even though I could not understand what people said ."
1143,"In other words , I do not care about the people around me ."
1144,I do n't know if it is good or bad .
1145,I am still eagerly wishing that I could use English like a native .
1146,"Second , I am going shopping ."
1147,"I hope I will have a good weekend , and so will all of you !"
1148,"At first , when I did n't understand the meanings of new words , I looked them up in the dictionary ."
1149,"But , by doing that , I did n't read quickly ."

1155,My friend told me about this web site .
1156,"And if you know a good place for my study abroad , please tell me : D"
1157,I will go to graduate school next year .
1158,"In Japan , most graduate students start looking for a job in their first year ( except for those who go for a doctorate ) ."
1159,I 'd like to experience working overseas before looking for a more permanent job .
1160,So I 'll think about taking a year off to join an internship program in Europe .
1161,I wrote that I often licked my lips before .

1165,It is generally accepted that our country called Japan has been influenced by many great people across the country .
1166,I think one female singer is the latest great person who produces a powerful effect on Japan .
1167,I would like to write about her impact in this essay .
1168,"For example , she often sings her own name in her songs ."
1169,"Not only are her songs unique , but her fashion sense is as well ."
1170,"For example , she dyes her hair into strange colours ; white , yellow and green ."
1171,Her costumes are also sexy and unusual .
1172,"Recently , she wore a black onion costume when she appeared on `` Room of the Tetsuko `` which is Japanese famous TV program , because Tetsuko 's hair style looks like an onion ."
1173,"Furthermore , LADY GAGA gave Tetsuko candy that she took out of her spiral hair ."
1174,Many Japanese people were so surprised .
1175,I went to a baseball game .
1176,I am a Hanshin Tigers fan .
1177,I saw someone waving Japanese flags on the bleachers .
1178,"Not a problem , but it does n't fit with a baseball game ."
1179,Normally they use Hanshin Tiger 's flags .
1180,Then I could see they were a foreigner .
1181,Then I understood .
1182,That is what 's most important !
1183,"In Japanese , New year 's resolution is called `` HOUFU `` ."
1184,Most of their `` HOUFU `` is about their work .
1185,"At Japanese workplace 's parties , almost everyone talks about work ."
1186,I 'm tired of that topic .
1187,"hmm . English is easy , but people regard it as difficult ."
1188,Why do people think English is very difficult ?
1189,"Actually , English is very simple ."
1190,Who makes English difficult ?
1191,English teachers !
1192,They are saying that English is hard for you .
1193,"So you need help , such as a friend , teacher , and so on ."
1194,This is a lie .
1195,"When I 'm depressed , I feel everything will turn in a bad way ."
1196,"I ca n't connect with my boyfriend , because he is at the party hooking up with some girls ."
1197,One of my friends have n't replied to my e - mail because she got in trouble or she does n't wanna talk with me .
1198,I dreamed somebody in my family will die and wake up crying .
1199,Actually nothings . bad has happened .
1200,How can I wake up from this nightmare here ?
1201,"Today , I gave a presentation ."
1202,I spoke well and confidently .
1203,I did n't get nervous at all .
1204,"However , I failed to illustrate the next subject ."
1205,I finished the presentation thanks to friends and our teacher .
1206,I felt I needed to make lots of effort to improve my English .
1207,Someday I want to give a good presentation like the other students .
1208,"After the lesson , I went to the library to return a DVD ."
1209,"Then , I went to the agency to upgrade my driver 's license , but it turned out I was not able to upgrade it ."
1210,"I need to submit a certification , but until I contact the Japanese embassy for it , I ca n't get a new license ."
1211,After that I went to a bank to get some information about how to open a bank account .
1212,"On the way home , I dropped by an appliance store in Southgate and bought a portable radio ."
1213,"John , a kind clerk , recommended a good one ."
1214,He showed me one that works with solar power and also has a dynamo crank .
1215,Of course I got that one .
1216,After that I went to a bicycle shop and they only handle special types of bicycles .
1217,So I went there for nothing .
1218,Finishing the presentation was a big load off my mind .
1219,Now I can get ready for my final examination tomorrow .

1229,so I decided to go canada and already got a working holiday visa .
1230,after 5 months I 'll go there .
1231,I have n't decided anything .
1232,"the place I 'll go , how to use my working holiday visa well . . ."
1233,I got a working holiday visa so that I could learn English at a language school .
1234,"After that , I thought I 'd get a Marketing or Business certification , and use it to get an internship ."
1235,are too high .
1236,I need money to live .
1237,"So far , there 's nothing that can get me a good internship ."

1260,"My career , engineering , really takes time to be completed , and it is really easy to lose years if you do not pass one subject in time ."
1261,"I started to study this week , I feel confident I will have a nice semester ."
1262,A bit of good news is that a coworker lent me a book about kanji . . .

1838,There are many voice overs through out the tv show .
1839,I need to prepare for an exam related to my work which I 'm going to take next week .
1840,"I also want to make more time for learning English , but I ca n't manage to do both of them ."
1841,I wish I could be a little better at multi - tasking .
1842,I graduated from driving school last week .
1843,I want to get my license soon !
1844,I 'm interested in japanese and korean culture .
1845,I love anime and manga .
1846,I think Japan should focus more on relations with other nations for several reasons .
1847,"Secondly , among Asian nations , Japan is the only advanced nation , so Japan should show other nations how to deal with international relations with European nations and the United States ."
1848,Japanese people are hard - working and our politicians and diplomats have had good relations with the United Stated and European nations .
1849,One was that Japan should focus more on relations with other Asian nations because Japan should take a role as a leading nation among Asian countries .
1850,"The other reason was that Japan knows a lot about relations with European nations and America , so we should use the advantage to communicate and have a good relationship with other nations ."
1851,My desk in my office is usually much neater than most of my colleagues ' desks .
1852,However a lot of ( hardcopy ) documents have been piling up on my desk and the drawer is / has become full of them recently .
1853,I decided to take some time to check whether the documents were really necessary for me or not .
1854,"To my surprise , the result was that I could reduce the pile to one fifth its original amount ."
1855,"If you have some trouble in your work [ at your job ] , I recommend that you clean your desk ."
1856,I do not know how to memorize English .
1857,". Firstly , I want to learn basic conversational English ."
1858,How should I start studying ?
1859,I went to view cherry blossoms with my wife last Sunday .
1860,We bought some coffee and cake .
1861,We enjoyed eating cake and drinking coffee under the Cherry Blossoms beside the river side .
1862,Everyone enjoyed cooking BBQ and playing light sports .
1863,I had a relaxing time .
1864,came to the branch
1865,Today it is a holiday and the weather 's nice .
1866,"If I had plans , I think I would go to somewhere , but . . . . . ! !"
1867,"I did n't have plans today . so , I woke up at 11 : 00 . then I ate lunch , watched a DVD and played ukulele ."
1868,"If it 's a nice day tomorrow , I will go ( out ) somewhere !"
1869,What a bother !
1870,"That remains me , I have to finish my homework by the day after tomorrow ."
1871,Could you please teach me the reason in detail .
1872,I found that I 've been writing my journal in English for around 70 days .
1873,I want to express my ideas or my feelings in English more and more .
1874,"Before writing a journal , I did n't pay attention to nouns ."
1875,"Though there are two kinds of nouns ( one is a countable noun , the other is an uncountable noun ) in English , we do n't have such ideas in Japanese ."
1876,I especially do n't understand abstract nouns .
1877,"On the other hand , I tend to think how I express Japanese phrases in English every day ."
1878,"For example , while I talk with my friend , I think of how I can express this feeling in English ."
1879,"Then , when I talk with my English teacher , I often replied with two or three words before , but I tend to be able to reply with complete sentences which I made , even though my completesentences are wrong in most cases ."
1880,"However , if I keep practicing these things , I will be able to master English someday ."
1881,"Therefore , I think keeping a diary is one of the best ways indeed ."
1882,I have been jogging for an hour almost every night for three months .
1883,"Though McDougall recommended running using low - cushion shoes in this book , I think there is a risk for beginners to hurt their foot ."
1884,"Actually , I hurt my feet using Vibram FiveFingers shoes ."
1885,"So , although I do n't know if I can run the whole distance , I decided to try a full marathon in April and an ultramarathon in June ."
1886,The tree - planting ceremony was held near where I live .
1887,"It was a very big ceremony there ,"
1888,because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves .
1889,"There are many roads that had been repaired , re - paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held , to prepare for the ceremony ."
1890,"The Emperor and Empress planted seeds and various kinds of tree saplings , including pollen - less cedars ."
1891,"It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony , but many other attractions were there , like some dances , reading some essays , etc ."
1892,"We wish the trees will grow up healthily , and that we will keep the mountains and nature beautiful ."
1893,This is my first diary .
1894,I got together with my friends to have an OKONOMIYAKI party today .
1895,"Okonomiyaki , which looks like a pancake , is a kind of local food in Japan ."
1896,We enjoyed eating them and talking .
1897,"In addition , we watched JUDO in the olympics ."
1898,It was pity that the Japanese player could n't win a first prize .
1899,Each country 's national debt breeds distrust of the world economy after the crisis in Greece .
1900,"After Lehman 's fall , the global depression has necessitated fiscal action , so it seems natural that the debts are growing large ."
1901,"In addition , Japan keeps current - account surplus , so Japan might be considered to be relatively stable ."
1902,"Without good prospect for rapid improvement of each country 's current account , the crisis / threat ? of default seems to get more serious , and I think the crucial period is yet to come ."
1903,I logged into this site Lang - 8 for the first time .

1955,"Having finished reading aloud while training , I took a walk ."
1956,The goal for Walking in Japan is 9200 steps for men and 8300 steps for women .
1957,I do n't know how many steps I took today
1958,but my grandmother takes about 2000 steps in 20 minute walks
1959,I think I took not less than 6000 steps .
1960,Adding 3200 steps can make me reach that goal .
1961,I 'll dosome walking every day from today on

1969,"It is a very funny place , and I have met many friends there , wish you guys would like it ."

1979,I downloaded some white brich songs .
1980,I love this kind of weather
1981,These days the weather has become cooler than before .
1982,"The reason is because it 's cold in the North ( so we , people who live in the South , can feel the cold from there - I do n't know how to write this sentence ) and it 's also the end of November , so it 's nearly Christmas ."
1983,"If I did n't have to go to work I 'm sure I would be sitting in a coffee shop , drinking my favourite coffee and chatting with my friends now ."

1992,Please correct my writing .
1993,Parents should n't show their bad habits or behaviors in front of their children .
1994,This is because children tend to quickly imitate what occurs in front of them .
1995,"If a parent littered , their child would simply think that it is n't wrong , and he or she would rapidly imitate this bad behavior ."
1996,This is bad .
1997,"Furthermore , once children fall into a bad habit , it is difficult for them to change ."

2065,"According to estimates of a private research institute , the value of individual shares and investment trust funds had gone down by about 100 trillion yen between the end of June last year and the end of September this year ."
2066,This is unforgivable to the people who have invested their savings for their post - retirement years .
2067,"According to stock traders , the plunge in New York market last week is because of the anxiety about the U . S ."
2068,"financial system , but the one this week is because of the clearer tendency of the recession ."
2069,If the actual economy in the US
2070,"is really aggravated , it is very dire for Japan , which depends mainly on exports ."
2071,"Though there was a brief recovery from `` Lost Ten Years `` , it is said that economy in Japan is also in a stage of recession ."

2112,"My English does n't seem to get better , especially in speaking , and I also felt bad when my favorite english teacher kept saying ' I ca n't hear you . ' last class ."
2113,"When I sang songs there , I realized that my voice is not quiet ( basically / naturally ) , just I usually talk quiet ."
2114,I will try to speak louder as much as possible .
2115,"I may feel like I 'm yelling , but I also noticed that it is not when I recorded and heard my voice ."
2116,I hope you enjoy good food and have fun on Thanksgiving Day !
2117,"In my spare time , I often rent some comedies , not only the new ones , but also the old classic movies ."

2119,"And then I would forget those annoyances , and become happy ."
2120,"We watch comedy not just for fun , but also to get some life philosophy ."
2121,"There is much we can learn from him - - not only from his movies , but also from the person himself ."
2122,I have been working for exactly one year now .
2123,"Since I started working , I have discovered a few disadvantages / weaknesses in myself ."
2124,I made some mistakes during the process of work and felt unhappy about it at the time .
2125,"Actually , I care about so many things regarding my work ."
2126,I do n't know why I care so much .
2127,I did n't know I had these kinds of weaknesses when I was a student .
2128,"By the way , it 's very different between the part time and the full time job , so I do n't have any presumptions at work anymore ."
2129,"Any opportunities for working are good , so try and see which one might be suitable for you ."
2130,"It was raining , so I went to the nearest station in my car , after I took my son to kindergarten ."
2131,"( Usually , I go there with my bike to exercise . )"

2146,"Scientists found that in the last fifty years of twentieth century , hundreds of thousands of species had become extinct on earth ."
2147,"As a result , when scientists studied the six mass extinctions of organisms in natural history , they found surprisingly that the earth is experiencing the seventh mass extinction of organisms right now ."
2148,Features of The Seventh Mass Extinction of Organisms
2149,"The past six mass extinctions all happened over thousands or millions of years ago , whereas the current rate of species extinction , according to calculations , is much greater compared to before ."
2150,The extinction of modern organisms is due to human 's activities .
2151,Humans are the only species that can cause the mass extinctions of other species in the history of life .
2152,People 's economic activities like the over - exploiting of forests and excess reclamation lead to the changing of environment of other species .
2153,Pollution from human activities endanger the survival of wildlife .
2154,"Because of the population explosion , people are competing with animals for resources , which also results in their extinction ."

2182,"He and I have been at the same group for about five years , since 2005 ."
2183,He was our group leader .
2184,"Therefore , I was shocked and felt somewhat betrayed when I heard the news of his change of job ."
2185,But it is also true that I respect him a lot as a good engineer and I like him as a good elder friend .
2186,"Anyway , we will miss him ."
2187,"Although I work hard everyday just like the main character ,"
2188,I wonder if I 'm gaining experience for my future .
2189,"In the end , she was promoted and got a nice boyfriend in the movie ."

2193,I wanna meet foreigners and make friends .

2195,My First Diary ! !
2196,Now I am studying English sicnce I go to America next month .
2197,I 'm very excited but
2198,I 'm worried if I can speak English .
2199,So I am studying English now .
2200,My friend told me about this site .
2201,"Well , I go to America with my friend and we will stay for one month ."
2202,I went there once when I was in high school .
2203,"At that time , I was 17 years old ."
2204,My friend and I stayed with our host family and we had a very good time .
2205,I appreciated my host family since I had very good time . I came to like America more .
2206,"This time , I want to go to visit my host family and tell about my life after that ."
2207,Anyway I use this site about for month to improve my English .
2208,I am glad if anyone corrects my diary .
2209,It told me that I can use this website to practise my writing .
2210,I have n't written in my dairy for a long time .
2211,Since I had a cold I did n't get up early .
2212,I 've been waking up at 6 in the morning recently .
2213,Today I helped someone to get their property back .
2214,It was on a table where people eat foods .
2215,Someone forgot that bank book .
2216,Because I saw the company name inside that book .
2217,I went to the bank and returned the book .
2218,I am happy that I could help people today .
2219,"Today , I went to the Job Search Centre with the necessary documents ."
2220,I woke so early and it was even before my alarm clock rang ( went off ) .
2221,Recently I always woke in the middle of the night .
2222,"Since it was too early , I laid down again ."
2223,The Centre is about ten - minute 's walk from the nearest station .
2224,"There were some people waiting for their turn , so I picked up a reception sheet and waited for my turn ."
2225,After the reception ( consultation ? ) I got an introduction card for my application for a new job .
2226,It is the job of a receptionist at a hotel in Asakusa which is far from my apartment .
2227,I will receive a call on whether they plan to have an interview with me .
2228,They will make the decision if they are going to employ ( hire ) me .
2229,I am old and only had a few good jobs in my career .
2230,So it is difficult to get a new job but I must not lose hope .
2231,I want to improve my English writing .
2232,I 'm a student in the beijing .
2233,but I want to learn about english . english is very good .
2234,because I will go study abroad .
2235,"so , I hope that everyone will help me with my english ."
2236,I 've studied English for so long that I can listen and understand what native speakers say .
2237,"But I have to admit , I ca n't speak well enough ."
2238,I want to reach the level where I can make a good presentation in front of an audience .
2239,Sometimes I become desperate and feel that nobody can achieve that level unless you lived in other countries when you were young .
2240,But that idea is wrong .
2241,I came to that conclusion when I saw a presentation by a president of a company .
2242,He graduated from an American business school .
2243,But he had n't been to the US before business school .
2244,He did an excellent presentation about his expertise and his business .
2245,He answered all the questions with a sense of humor .
2246,Now I believe that I can be a good English speaker someday if I keep studying .
2247,Chopsticks are a famous Asian traditional tool for eating .
2248,The are made of wood .
2249,Should not ( spear the food ? ) .
2250,"I 've lived in Japan since I was born , but it is difficult for me to pick up food as small as a soybean ."
2251,I think it is necessary that I should practice more .
2252,This news program uses easier English than `` abc NEWS `` .
2253,Do you know about it ?
2254,These must have reflected themselves in her feelings .
2255,"I 'm going to go to the Tokyo for the All Japan JHS chorus competition , so I will leave my house early in the morning ."
2256,I will arrive noon and go to the NHK concert hall .
2257,"After All Japan JHS chorus competition , I want to have fun with my friends ."
2258,The question I often want to ask a foreigner
2259,What causes a person to leave his hometown and go to a place where even the language is different ?
2260,Many answers would probably be to learn a new language .
2261,But it must take a lot of courage .
2262,"If your friend is going to a new country , what advice will you give to him or her ? like experience or somethng else"
2263,I just became a member of this site .
2264,"I am a totally newbie , like a baby deer trying to get up on his feet"
2265,so spank me up ( ? ) to become a good English writer .
2266,"Please correct them if they are very wrong , or if there is a better way to say it ."
2267,I hope I get used to this sooner . . .
2268,but is this correct ?
2269,Here 's another question .
2270,Christmas is over
2271,Now Christmas is over and I feel relief .
2272,I got married to a Canadian guy .
2273,Anyway Christmas is over . . .
2274,"As you know , there have been many earthquakes in Japan ."
2275,"In the Tohoku region , people have been suffering from disease , and shortage of food and water , because of the tsunami and the earthquake ."
2276,"However , I live in Kanagawa perfecture , which is far from Tohoku region ."
2277,"Therefore , I can support people in the region only by donation and saving power ."
2278,I feel I 'm powerless .
2279,"So , I think they are also suffering ."
2280,"I tried to get in touch with them over and over , but I couldn ` t ."
2281,I 'm very worried about my relatives .
2282,"As I ca n't get in touch with them , all I have to do is to pray that they are alive and healthy ."
2283,We entered the big graveyard and the pitch - dark tunnel one pair at a time on a dare .
2284,We walked the sandy beach on the way .
2285,I like the sea at night .
2286,The moon and stars that night were very beautiful .
2287,"The moon was bright , so we were n't in the dark ."
2288,So the test of courage did n't scare me .
2289,Because I just registered on Lang - 8 .
2290,I think this is a really nice web - site for learning languages .
2291,I wanted to find out more about this before .
2292,"by the way , will someone really correct my diary ?"
2293,"Today , a famous Japanese actress was placed on the wanted list ."
2294,Her name is `` Noripi `` . She is 38 years old .

2299,I look up a lot of words when I 'm on duty or studying every day .
2300,It always helps me and it 's a necessity for me .
2301,"Oh , it 's a big problem ."
2302,"I suppose , I used it too much , or it has just reached the end of its life ."
2303,Have you ever heard of it ?

2361,Then I realized that God has always cursed people .
2362,If he did n't want the living beings then why did he create all of us to see this type of event . I am totally angry with God .

2383,"For example , yogurt containing lactic acid bacteria is believed to make us healthy and prevent disease , because these bacteria strengthen the immune system ."
2384,"However , it is still unclear how much the probiotics affect the immune system and prevent the disease ."
2385,Our environments including our body already have many bacteria and we are exposed to them all time .
2386,The most of data demonstating the benefits to our body are clamed by companies producing fermented foods .
2387,There are research conflicts and we need much more fair studies .

2462,"My situation is that I did n't know ( that ) I had made a mistake on my name until the staff of the test center told me , which was just before the test began ."
2463,So my question is the following :
2464,`` Is the test center obligated to report to ETS if they discover an inconsistency between the registered name and the name on the student 's passport ? ``
2465,"I ask this question because I have some friends who had also made a similar mistake on their name , however , the staff of the test center helped them report it to ETS ."
2466,"Eventually , all of them had their names corrected successfully !"
2467,"( Okay , let 's get / ) Going back to my question ."
2468,"If your answer is `` YES `` , then I could seek damages from the test center where I took the test ."
2469,"( Because of / ) Due to their negligence , I had spent USD160 and got nothing !"
2470,My TOEFL score is invalid becaus they did n't have my name corrected !
2471,"If your answer is `` NO `` , then I will have doubts on the reliability of ETS ."
2472,"In other words , anyone could have replaced me to take the test ."
2473,"The staff at the test center knew that there was a mistake on my name , but they still let me to take the test ."

2498,I often have had nightmares since we broke up .
2499,"Therefore , I am tired at work ."
2500,How long will this condition continue ?
2501,"Yesterday and the day before , I played in a band ."
2502,"The song I played was `` HEAVEN `` ( Janne da arc ) , `` God knows `` and `` Empty color days `` ."
2503,After I read an article titled `` Are you happy with life ? `` in a newsgroup .
2504,I asked myself .
2505,I do n't really know whether I am happy or not .
2506,"Sometimes , I would like more pretty clothes even though I have have so many clothes already ."
2507,"My mother always scolds me , `` Why do you buy so many clothes , but never wear them `` Heehee , I do n't know why I just want to buy them at that moment ."

2513,Today I went to a restaurant with my family .
2514,It was the last chance we had to rest this summer .
2515,"My father said , `` Let 's eat a delicious lunch ! ``"

2521,It 's raining today .
2522,so I spoke slowly .
2523,I will study harder in English pronunciation tomorrow .
2524,"Developed countries often give financial aid to poor / developing countries , but this alone does not solve poverty . Developed countries should also give other types of help to poor countries instead of / in addition to financial aid ."
2525,"Currently , it is not uncommon for rich countries offer financial aid to the poor countries , for the sake of helping them shake off ( overcome ) poverty ."
2526,"But the effort seems to not be effective enough , and as a result many impoverished countries still suffer from poverty and other problems ."
2527,"Therefore , in what form of aid should be offered to the poor countries has been a topic of discussion ."
2528,Some people are convinced that wealthy countries should offer aid in alternative forms such as education or technology instead of strictly financial support .
2529,There is no doubt that one country can not develop to be a strong one while it is always relying on other countries ' help .
2530,It is through the development of education and technology that one country can really push another country to become a wealthy one .
2531,"When a country is so poor that it can not develop its own education and technology by itself , the assistance from rich countries can make a great impact ."
2532,"India is a country which used to be so poor that it could not afford the huge domestic cost , but it became more powerful than ever before due to the development of computer technology , which it benefitted from the technology aids received from developed countries ."
2533,"Many poor countries rely on direct financial support to relieve pressures of poverty , which they can use in different ways to alleviate the poverty , such as buying foods to combat hunger , or buying military equipment for the stability of the country ."
2534,"In some cases , the citizens of such countries will continue to suffer from hunger and hardship if financial aid is withdrawn ."
2535,The main issue should be how the poor countries make good use of these aids in order to improve the well - being of their citizens .
2536,"I just learnt a new phrase , `` to the core . `` So I would like to try and make some example sentences ."
2537,"He changed a lot , all the way to his core ."
2538,I am very happy .
2539,"However , my salary was reduced by 15 percent to ease the companies financial crisis ."
2540,"Then , my allowance was reduced 20 percent by my wife ."
2541,I can not drink as frequently with my subordinates anymore .
2542,"I will buy small cakes for my wife ( and family ) , and I hope I can negotiate an increase in my allowance ."
2543,"I bought the blue - ray / hard - disk recorder on installment last year , and will keep repaying my hire - purchase agreement from my allowance ."
2544,"Today , My wife will watch the TV program ; SMAP - SMAP that was recorded by my wife at last night ."
2545,I really hope my wife will increase my allowance .
2546,I woke up and now I am drinking coffee .

3276,"And being able to learn all of that from people with such different backgrounds is what makes UWC so special to me , it 's the perfect place for everything that I want to do ."
3277,"I just ca n't imagine the way it would impact my life , such a wonderful experience ."
3278,My brother has often made me sad since he finished his army service .
3279,He began to smoke and play games day and night in a cybercafe .
3280,"Because this , my little sister and I had to often go and find him in the cybercafe ."
3281,His phone was always off and he did 't go to home to sleep at night .
3282,"I remebered waiting for him , resulting in me weeping all night ."
3283,My parents hoped that he would go to China together with them and that maybe thay can change his temper and bad habits .
3284,"But he insists on staying in Taiwan and on keeping his bad behavior , making us feel pain and helpless ."
3285,"Today my father on a rare visit , came to Taiwan . I was very happy ."
3286,"And then my brother said that he had a test . ( I do n't trust him , he had to be going to cybercafe . )"
3287,"So we waited for him until 6 o ' clock , and when he did n't still come home and my father lost his temper ."
3288,"( If it 's 10 : 00 o ' clock and he still has n't come home , we decide to lock the door . )"
3289,"At 8 : 00 , when my brother came home , we were preparing to shout at him ."
3290,"Suddently he said , `` I have decided to go to China with father , because I ca n't hold onto myself `` ."
3291,We were so surprised and began to smile .
3292,It 's so surprising that I ca n't believe it !
3293,I always really worry about him .
3294,"Althought I do n't know him going to China is a good thing , that he want to change himself makes me feel happy ."
3295,It 's one of Japan 's Holidays today .
3296,"By the way , I like mountains much more ."
3297,( as holidays of course ) .
3298,"Do you know that Japan ( being describled as a workaholic country ) has 15 holidays , the most out of all developed countries ?"
3299,"Of course , I did n't know ."
3300,"I ( have ) a little free time , so I ( have restarted ) using Lang - 8 ! !"

3306,Work will likely be hard / tough tomorrow .
3307,"It was very hot there , and I got sunburn on my left arm ."
3308,Athens is full of people and dilapidated ancient monuments .
3309,The trip to Athens did n't relax me .
3310,Result of 17th September work
3311,"Today , I thought [ about something ] very deeply ."
3312,"What should an artist be like , what should a bussinesman be like ."

3318,"Today , I will write about my trip again ."
3319,There was a vivid magenta Bougainvillea near the Kailua beach park .
3320,I ordered a delicious fruit salad .
3321,This beach is very famous for the sea turtles that come to sunbathe there .
3322,"At that time , there were no sea turtles on the beach , instead there was a Hawaiian monk seal ."
3323,He was big and was just sleeping on the beach .
3324,I think that all bus systems in the world hastheir advantages and disadvantages .
3325,I have lots of homework .
3326,So I 'm going to go to the library to do it . . . . .
3327,"Instead of not doing it , I got great memories ! !"
3328,"Today , I went to a dentist ."
3329,because I had a toothache last night -
3330,"it is very painful , I do n't want to go to the dentist ."

3333,The baby has arrived !
3334,The year 2011 has started with the arrival of a new baby in my family .
3335,"His older brother , Pax , likes to take care of him ."
3336,It 's lovely to see the older trying to hold the little one and to hear what he says to the baby .
3337,"People say that the older one often gets jealous of the newcomer and acts nasty , or behaves like a baby ."
3338,But I can see now that Pax sometimes pretends to be a small baby - he sometimes wants to feed / nurse from my breast and he crawls .
3339,I look forward to seeing how they their relationship as brothers develops .
3340,I hope they can be the best of friends with each other .
3341,I 'm starting to learn English
3342,I 'm a university student .
3343,( looks like a fencing ) I started it as an elementary student .
3344,So I 've been playing Kendo for a long time .
3345,"Last year I went to Toulouse , France for one month ."
3346,That was a very good place ! !
3347,"It was very funny , because the first time I tried to speak French I could n't communicate with people well ."
3348,"So after few days , I started always using English ."
3349,I 'm interested in the cultures of various countries .
3350,I want to talk with people from different countries .
3351,"The Project Manager should have a set of skills or techniques , including the abilities to raise the sharp questions , detect the unknown assumptions , and solve the conflicts between people , etc ."
3352,Also including many skills in modern management as well .
3353,"The major responsibility of the Project Manager is to identify different risks that affect the success of the Project , which should be measured by formal or informal ways throughout the whole project ."
3354,Risk always generates from the uncertainty of the project .
3355,A successful project manager often takes the risk of paying to much attention to the matter .
3356,"I agree with such a opinion as a qualified project manager comes not only from studying , but more from practicing . ."
3357,I will go on a school trip to Hokkaido from September 15th to the 18th .

3360,So I ca n't do n't teach you anything .
3361,But I will tell you about it when I return from my school trip .
3362,I first read the Japanese version when I was 6 or 7 years old .
3363,This is the second book in the series `` My Father 's Dragon `` as you know .
3364,The English is easy but it makes me clearly imagine each scene .
3365,The rhythm of the sentences make it easy to read .
3366,This story begins with a scene in which a dragon was saved and flew away from an island where ferocious animals had locked him up .
3367,9 - year old Elmer saved the dragon .
3368,Then they were on their way home .
3369,First they came across Tangerina Island with many tangerines .
3370,"After suffering a storm , they flew down to a little green island ."
3371,There they met some canaries whose king was sick from curiosity .
3372,This is the end of the first part .
3373,I will write about the final part tomorrow .
3374,"Because , I ( study ) with my friend K , about optimistic training for special education ( educated ) children ."
3375,I wanted to study this long time ago .
3376,"So , I felt ( feel ) that today is a day which my dreams comes true !"
3377,"So , I felt satisfied"
3378,it turned sunny
3379,Tomorrow Im gon na take the SSAT .

3389,"Every time he came to our house before , he brought us something nice and exotic from China - however , he had ran out of souvenirs that he had brought from home that particular night ."
3390,So he handed to each of my daughters a plastic cage in which a little creature was making rattling noises on the pebbles .
3391,I loved animals but I had never fancied reptiles that much .
3392,"So as to be polite , I suprisingly told our guest a white lie - commenting that the turtles he brought were absolutely aadorable ."
3393,"Years passed , and they grew as time flew by ."
3394,I once brought them to a vet when they got sick . They suffered symptoms like having no appetite and swollen eyes . The treatment was two shots and it cost me 200 dollars .
3395,"Now , I love them so much !"
3396,It 's so funny in an ironical way that love seems to appear out of nowhere .
3397,It 's pure emotion towards these turtles .
3398,"My daughter has named the turtles Mai - chan and Chibi - chan , but I 'm actually secretly calling them Julia and Robert ."
3399,I 'm very excited for finding this site .
3400,I 'm learning English and want to improve it .
3401,I did n't know there was a useful website like this .
3402,programming is very difficult
3403,"today , I start to study programming ."
3404,but I did n't understand php ( ? ) .
3405,it is very difficult .
3406,I 'm writing a diary entry in English for the first time .
3407,It 's travel to a foreign country with my father .
3408,"When I was a child , I promised my father that I would become able to speak English and to take him to a foreign country ."
3409,"So , I will study English and take him to a foreign country ."
3410,On monday morning if you have breakfast in an Italian bar you 'll hear comments about the results of Sunday 's football matches .
3411,"In the Italian championship there are 20 teams ( in Premier League ) ; the teams with the best players are : Juventus , Inter , Milan and Rome ."
3412,"Every Sunday the teams begin playing at 3 o ' clock p . m . , the match lasts 90 minutes ."
3413,"Soon after the games end , sports programs air on tv till 7 p ."
3414,"There are link - ups with sports journalist in each stadium , interviews with the coaches or players and images of several goals , corner kicks , free kicks , penalty kicks , expulsions , warnings and failed goals ."
3415,"After prime time , other sports programs start again for those who did n't stay at home in the afternoon watching the television ."
3416,On Monday morning after `` a day `` television commentaries there are also those of the fans !
3417,Why did I pick that ?
3418,Actually I do not remember why I chose the phrase .
3419,I would be able to call myself a `` nomad . ``
3420,Because I have been unable to stay in one place for more than 3 months .
3421,"Because of that experience , I could do jobs with various skills ."
3422,I do not know how long my schedule to stay here is .
3423,Although many people living in this accommodation are getting worried
3424,I can experience diverse lifestyles with this time in Australia .
3425,"At least , I will exactly predict that I think I 'll get good experience in Australia"
3426,if I return to South Korea .
3427,Did you hear the news that an American guy won a $ 232 million jackpot ?
3428,I ca n't even imagine such an amount !
3429,He 's a really lucky guy !
3430,I wish I were him .
3431,But I worry a little that this much money will drive him crazy or ruin his life .
3432,The mass media reports on him excessively .
3433,"I know this is just to get viewers ' attention , me included ."
3434,I think they should reflect on their sensation - seeking nature .
3435,I hope the people surrounding him leave him alone a little .
3436,when I draw a deep breath I feel better .
3437,but I feel lonley .
3438,I broke up with my boyfriend few weeks ago .
3439,I ca n't even see him because he lives in another country .
3440,"and also , I broke off relationship with a friend ."
3441,she was my best friend .
3442,"but she made me feel bad , I do n't wanna get in touch with her anymore ."
3443,It 's really a hard time for me .
3444,however I feel relief .
3445,I 'm trying to get a job .
3446,I 'm gon na make money and then I 'll go to travel alone .
3447,"china , tibet , nepal , India , and Thailand !"
3448,"I failed to get a job few times , but It 's Ok ."
3449,I keep trying .
3450,I hope I make new good friends ! !
3451,I have a toothache today .
3452,I 'm wondering whether I should go to a dental clinic or not .
3453,"This is my favorite subject , and it is so interesting !"
3454,The picture you can see in my profile the package of a jigsaw puzzle .
3455,"I thought I could finish it in a week or so ,"
3456,but it 's very very difficult ! ! ! ! ! !
3457,"Most of the pieces are red , so all the pieces look alike ."
3458,"For your information , I have n't finished it yet ."
3459,My hobbies are skiing and judo .
3460,I have skied since I became a junior high school student .
3461,But the cost is incredible high ! !
3462,"On the other hand , judo is a reasonable sport ."
3463,I have a black belt .
3464,"But recently , the day does n't exist for me because I stay awake all night long and then slept until the moon"
3465,is shining right above my head .
3466,"it is kind of weird that no matter how hard I try , it 's getting worse and"
3467,"It 's already eight in the morning and no need to say , I my eyes are still open even"
3468,though it is breakfast time !
3469,I will creep into my bed in a few minute .
3470,Why did I choose today education as a subject ?
3471,Maybe because as a father whose child is finishing kindergarten I 'm concerned about what my daugther is going to be taught in the following years .
3472,"And because I realize , now that it has become my problem , that nowadays education in schools needs to face several challenges to be useful for children and for society ."
3473,"Of course I 'm not an expert , and without doubt I 'll be inaccurate and subjetive , but I 'm going to talk about how I percieve the situation ."
3474,First of all I think we must face the fact that the problems are not going to be solved by changing the curriculum if we do n't help teachers to adapt themselves to it .
3475,"We 're going to take a tent , a sleeping bag , and so on with us so that we can sleep in the tent on the mountain ."
3476,"It 's my first time staying in a tent on a mountain , so it sounds really exciting ."
3477,It has an obelisk at its peak .
3478,I hope that I can carry all that heavy stuff and still enjoy climbing .
3479,I love traveling and I had never traveled by myself before . I felt it was time 4 me to slip away to get some fresh air outside in April .
3480,I surely know that it is irresponsible to disappear without saying goodbye to dad & mom .
3481,"what 's more , I definitely knew that I would hurt them , scare them and make them worry about me ."
3482,"but , at that moment , I just wanted to take my ticket , searching some places to calm down and release stress ."
3483,"Lijiang , a place where I could temporarily forget the pressure , slow down the pace and enjoy myself lounging around and taking pics freely and comfortably ."
3484,the old town really gave me a shot 2 purify and broaden my mind .
3485,I made friends with strangers and now I still keep in touch with them .
3486,"sometimes I 'd luv 2 review them , reminding me of those faces , the smell of sunshine and my footprints during the trip ."
3487,I 've been learning English in school for three years .
3488,"Three years ago I was learning German , which I studied for six years !"
3489,"And I was the best in the class , but now I 've forgotten everything . I wanna learn Finnish too , but it 's very difficult ."
3490,"I 'm interested in other cultures , especially Japan ( and others Asian countries too ) , so if you 're Japanese , Singaporean , Korean , or other Asian , just write to me ."
3491,And I go to the Badinh square to see the national flag rise .
3492,But many people go there earlier to exercise .
3493,"After the dysacousia whistle , the national anthem is sung strongly"
3494,Everybody has a decent and dignified stand and remain silent through the song .
3495,when the flag is on the top of the flag tower is the right time to finish the anthem .
3496,I 'm really excited right now ! ! !
3497,Actually my boyfriend can correct my essays but I do n't want to ask him . . . because it 's a little bit embarrassing .
3498,So I 'm using this site to improve my English skills .
3499,I think I 'll write a blog entry from time to time .
3500,And I 'm going to post a TOEFL writing essay as well : )
3501,I am embarrased to say that I am not good at English but love to learn it .
3502,"Besides that if you want to learn Japanese , I would happy to help you ,"
3503,"Well , let me cut my redundant introduction here and make some comments on latest news which drew my attention ."
3504,"According to Japanese TV news , some 46000 people return to Japan after spending their golden week holiday in a foreign country ."
3505,"Due to threat of swine flu , many people including nurses and airport staff check travelers ."
3506,I saw one of those travelers returning from mexico complained of the hassle at the airport .
3507,but he should n't have gone if he did n't want to complain .
3508,Remember that goverment warned against all non - essential travel in advance and there are some people working on this case now instead of spending vacation .
3509,Changing My Mind
3510,We finally decided on when we 're going to move .
3511,"We will move to another place on three consecutiveholidays : the 21st , 22nd & nbsp ; and 23rd of November ."
3512,"Therefore , I must pack all thestuff in my house alone in twenty days ."
3513,It sounds really tough and hard & nbsp ; for me . . . . . .
3514,I guess that my daughter will sometimes will help me but I do n't expect it .
3515,"In addition , if someone helps me , I will get confused about the contents of theboxes which I do n't pack by myself ."
3516,"Therefore , I want to pack them alone ."
3517,I 'm sure that I must pack over 200 boxes .
3518,Oh my gosh ! ! ! !
3519,"As we prepare to move , I will throw away all unnecessary things ."
3520,I know that there are a bunch of boxes which I have n't opened yet which I will after I moved here .
3521,"While I 've lived here , I bought a lot of things ."
3522,I regret the money I wasted to buy unnecessary things .
3523,Are you a person who can throw away unnecessary things ?
3524,In my case I 'm stingy and I ca n't boldlythrow things & nbsp ; away .
3525,And I 've kept a lot of cardboard boxes which have not been opened yet
3526,I will throw away all those boxes this time .
3527,I want to change my mind and be a better house manager .
3528,My home is very old . It was constructed more than thirty five years ago .
3529,"However , I like my home because it is very attractive !"
3530,One of the reasons is because of how kind the residents are .
3531,"Sometimes they scold him , but it is always tenderly because of his innocence ."
3532,"So I feel that many residents watch out for my son , and I 'm really thankful ."
3533,However I have to move in a few weeks !
3534,The new home is not so far from here and it has a more modern decor .
3535,"However , I have a confidence that I will miss my present sweet old home in the nearly future ."
3536,"I moved into Burwood , located in the western suburb of Sydney ."
3537,There are many Chinese in the city .
3538,"I have been to some other suburbs such as Silverwater , and Strathfield . I do have not have any information about them ."
3539,"However , it was more peaceful ."
3540,"I entered here as short - term stay . It is similar to being a backpacker , so I had to buy my own food ."
3541,"Luckily , it was near to Woolworth from my accommodation , so it was easy to buy food ."
3542,"As a result , I became acity person ."
3543,"When I lived in South Korea , I lived in the countryside ."
3544,It would take long time to adapt myself to this new life .
3545,I feel good now because the atmosphere is silent
3546,I drank too much and now I have a headache .
3547,But I had such a great night because I enjoyed eating Italian food and drinking .
3548,I expected to be hammered .
3549,I 've never had a headache while drinking .
3550,I 'm kind of shocked because I believe myself to be a poor drinker .
3551,I 'm absolutely indiscriminate when it comes to music and I can listen to everything from pop to classical music .
3552,I just laughand tease her that she is like a man .
3553,"I went with her , but just to hang out in Moscow ( I only like Metallica with the symphony orchestra and some ballads as well ) ."
3554,"This spring she is going to go to Helsinki , Finland to see Iron Maiden and she ca n't wait !"
3555,My first diary entry in English
3556,My occupation is a designer who makes a promotional movie in a certain game company .
3557,"I like reading ( foreign novels in particular ) , collecting figurines and surfing the internet ."
3558,I 'll write about those things in the diary .
3559,First time coming here
3560,There was a typhoon last night .
3561,"But today , is very funny ."
3562,I could see Mt .
3563,"It has a lot of snow , and it look very beautiful ."
3564,I mean I decided to use the paid study hall that my younger brother goes to .
3565,"At first , I could n't access the internet . by wireless LAN at the study hall ."
3566,But I have been able to access it the internet since I had complained to a janitor . of the study hall about that .
3567,Here it is quiet and comfortable for studying and working .
3568,I can put aside every temptations and break away from the crowd whenever I am here .
3569,I am now able to understand that why my brother goes there everyday .
3570,"By the way , I think the janitor of the study hall have has nothing to do all the time ."
3571,"I envy him , I want to run a study hall one day ."
3572,Which one is correct ?
3573,which sentence is correct ?
3574,I woke up early in the morning today .
3575,A cool wind / breeze was blowing through the window .
3576,Has autumn come ?
3577,"I was born in autumn , so I like this season ."
3578,It exists for autumn .
3579,"When I asked a question about the origin of the idiom `` cold turkey `` ,"
3580,"So he googled it , and then answered the question ."
3581,"If more English teachers had their classes online ,"
3582,it would become easier for English learners to take them .
3583,"I think it is a simple idea ,"
3584,My plan is : When I post a new entry on my blog in Chinese .
3585,"Then I will also post a new entry on Lang - 8 in English ,"
3586,Both of them will have the same content .
3587,"Last Friday , there was an Athletic Festival at my oldest daughter 's elementary school ."
3588,She enjoyed it and showed me an excellent scene in her foot - race .
3589,She was always in the last position out of the three members .
3590,Both boys and girls in groups of three participated in the relay race .
3591,She said that she was always last .
3592,Her mother told her never to give up !
3593,"In this race , she did n't get first place , but she still felt that she had won ."
3594,She gave us her best smile at the end of the day .
3595,"On Saturday , I went to a workshop about herbs ."
3596,Actually a close friend is Yoga teacher .
3597,"She is interested in all aspects of healthy living , including macrobiotic food ."
3598,", herbs , Ayurveda and so on ."
3599,"Influenced by her , I have become interested in my own body and mind too ."
3600,The workshop 's teacher came to my friend 's studio from the next prefecture !
3601,"She came to here by car , bringing lots of herbs and some tools ."
3602,She is like a sunflower and has a very natural attitude and positive power .
3603,I liked her immediately .
3604,"Today is over , I will tell you about the details of the workshop in my next journal ."
3605,Yesterday I played football ( soccer ) with my friends .
3606,We played from 10 : 00am to 12 : 00pm .
3607,But it was an awfully hot day in Okayama Japan yesterday .
3608,"One of my friends felt uncomfortable , and he vomited ."
3609,We baked in the blazing sun .
3610,My skin is still burning .
3611,"Every time when I see Jim Parsons or even hear his name , I ca n't help but burst into laughter ."
3612,He is a very popular comedian and plays the role of Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory .
3613,I like watching his show for two reasons .
3614,"The first reason is seeing his funny facial expressions , his movements , it is a really relaxing ."
3615,Whatever the mood you are in he can make you laugh .
3616,Just like uncle McDonald who is just trying to make you happy .
3617,"The second is that all his lines are well written , not just something you forget after the show ."
3618,"He puts his deep thoughts into a humorous way of expression , so you can always find something new and refreshing , you remember his magic smile on the TV ."
3619,This is why Jim Parsons always makes me laugh .
3620,"I just came back home now , I 'm tired today . . ."
3621,"I had an English class early in the morning , and then I had a part time job as a Teaching Assistant ."
3622,"It was a sunny morning but suddenly it began to rain when I was TA ( it 's an outdoor class ) , we got wet because of the rain . . ."
3623,"After that , I did my research for my master 's thesis until . . . . . ."
3624,That 's all the things I did today . . .
3625,Trip to see the cherry blossoms .
3626,We made a gipbap for a lunch picnic .
3627,"Anyway , since morning , the weather was already very dark and chilly ."
3628,"Then , we wondered whether buds will come into flower ."
3629,"Unfortunately , it did not ."
3630,"To see full blooms of cherry blossoms in Seoul , we may have to wait until this weekend ."
3631,"Finally , I know that the level of my English skills are the worst ."
3632,But I 'm happy because I got to know Lang - 8 and so many teachers ( = my new friends )
3633,I will think of English as fun and not studying . .
3634,"Sometimes I 'm so busy with work ,"
3635,but I will try to keep practicing .
3636,Thank you for all of your help again . .
3637,"I noticed a rule that she seems to have about hugging ; when I 'm hugging her baby sister , Haru - chan , she never asks me to hug ."
3638,Lang - 8 is very busy today .
3639,They tried to find the inspiration for their work from their familiar surroundings .
3640,"For example , Cluade Monet was the painter most attracted by the change of light and colour ."
3641,He drew the same scenes in differing lighting .
3642,But Renoir and Degas had a slightly different preference when choosing subjects .
3643,They enjoyed painting the people of the world .
3644,He especially drew his friends and families a lot .
3645,my ( or the ) Last entrance exam was not so cool
3646,I took an English exam last Sunday .
3647,Last time I took the exam was about one and a half years ago .
3648,"By taking same exam again , I found out that my English reading skills have gone down . . ."
3649,It seems I lost the sense of reading English .
3650,I had the chance to speak English with my friends .
3651,But I never actually read any books or wrote sentences in English .
3652,So it is understandable why my English went down . . .
3653,"In order to take back my English skills ,"
3654,I 'm going to read the book called `` Eat pray love `` in English
3655,Thanks for your help : )
3656,I like to go see movies .
3657,I watched a movie at a movie theater in Roppongi Hills .
3658,go watch a movie this year
3659,I tend to too concentrate on listening to English
3660,"I did n't know my English was improving after watching a movie , but I hope I will be able listen to more of their English if I go see a movie ."
3661,The 2010 World Cup will be held in South Africa .
3662,and there are only two months left .

3664,The 2002 Korea & Japan World Cupwas a historical event for Korea .
3665,"The Korean teamgo to the semi - final , and was ranked 4th in the tournament ."

3672,I wish I could speak English very well .
3673,I am used to going to a grocery store to buy food and drinks .
3674,I found a red package of chocolate there .
3675,I 'm learning English .
3676,Did you ever think how much you could save if you have unique knowledge about the airlines which other people do not have ?
3677,"Quite by chance , I came across on the Internet ( on humans ) , an airline employee who knows how to simply pay less . . ."
3678,It was a great surprise to me that such knowledge existed !
3679,I decided to check it out and bought his guides .
3680,"I must tell you that I 'm still in shock . Airlines are giving great discounts to the ordinary passengers , but not to me !"
3681,This guide is a real cost saver and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on their flights .
3682,"Anyways , I 'm here again !"
3683,"It 's a place that welcomes people from around the world , and of couse , local people as well ."
3684,"People who travel in Taiwan can enjoy their holidays , and enjoy some good time with local people , sharing their traveling experience or cultural differences ."
3685,"It 's a shame to become a victim , especially when people do n't deem that you are hurt . . ."
3686,We ca n't blame them because if they betray our trust even we are hurt .

3704,"We either have a winter day or an early summer day , but not a spring day ."
3705,It 's nice to meet you .
3706,"Most of all , I ca n't speak English ."

3711,I am writing about Norweigan Wood for the second time .

3719,Please pay attention to Eugene Park 's unbelievably miserable situation .
3720,"Once , he was one of the most promising violinists in the world ."
3721,"But now , he has lost his spirit and remarkable talent ."
3722,He even looks like a junkie .
3723,There is only one violin machine who can not play the violin passionately or happily anymore .
3724,Three of the major Korean newpapers and some portal sites are trying to cover it up .
3725,Many witnesses have already testified about his weird behavior .
3726,He does n't have to be treated like that .
3727,"So , please help free him ."
3728,Just a little attention could save him !
3729,"Nowadays , I enjoyplaying a car racing video game ( GT5 / PS3 ) ."
3730,I like AMG high speed driving lessons the most .
3731,"At first , I could n't drive with my heart ."
3732,"To put it in other words , `` Do n't break the flow `` ."
3733,"As you know , the place is now full of VIPs and government people from all over the world ."
3734,"Also , I 'm eating a Honey Roasted Peanuts ."
3735,It was made in U . S . A
3736,I joined Lang - 8 today .
3737,This is my first time writing a diary entry in English .
3738,I 'm studying English again .
3739,I hope I can find help and maybe some friends .
3740,"If you need any help in Korean , let me know ."
3741,"I can help you practice Korean , too ."
3742,We would like to express our appreciation for your cooperation for promoting activities of Fusen ( balloon ) Volleyball this time .
3743,"Additionally , we would like to ask you to please support us in the future ."
3744,We would like to present you these things below for your cooperation in promoting Fusen ( balloon ) Volleyball activities .
3745,We received the above things .
3746,"Every summer , a Friench student stays in Shiki , where I live ."
3747,Last year my family was a host family for a student that stayed for two weeks .
3748,"We had really good time with him , so I wanted to invite him back this year , but my mother said no because she knew she would be busy this summer ."
3749,"I was sorry that we would n't be hosting a student , so I wanted to help in some way and I asked if I could help ."
3750,"I expected some work , but she said the number of students was smaller than usual this year , so they did n't need help ."
3751,That was a disappointment for me because I had been eager to meet and talk with the new students .
3752,I was by myself because no other guests were in the restaurant .
3753,After I edited my first
3754,"diary , I was glad to get help from friends who come from other countries ."
3755,"There were deaths , which is sad ."
3756,Recently earthquakes have caused damages worldwide .
3757,It all makes me think that the end of our age is / may be near .
3758,"The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 ( 8 . 1 Richter ) , with about 10000 casualties ."
3759,The Government hid information because they did n't want people to realize the magnitude of the event .
3760,The Government also did it because they were to blame for most of the deaths caused by the bad planning of buildings .
3761,"This year , I have witnessed three or four tremors - I ca n't rememeber how many , my head is full ."
3762,"They were of high magnitude , between 5 . 5 and 7 in the Richter Scale ."
3763,I am worried that there will probably be a big earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city ( Mexico City ) .
3764,"The city is built over a lake system , so the buildings wo n't be able to withstand the pressure ."
3765,Up until what age do people restart their lives ?
3766,I saw a question on a Japanese website .
3767,`` Up until what age do people restart their lives ? ``
3768,"For instance , if you realized your occupation was not suitable for you , what would you do ?"
3769,"If you are young , it 's probably not so difficult to go back to school and try to become whatever you want ."
3770,I found many answers that reckoned it was around the age 30 .
3771,I was so sad to see this answer .
3772,30 is still kind of young .
3773,I guess it may vary depending on the country the respondent lived in .
3774,"What do you think , can an old man restart their life filled with hope ?"
3775,"If so , what age is the limit ?"
3776,"Since I already have a driver 's license in Japan , I felt applying for driver 's license here should n't be so difficult ."
3777,"Even so , regardless of driver 's license status overseas , everyone needs to take a paper test and a behind - the - wheel test again , so I took a test at the DMV ."
3778,"At first , I went to the nearest DMV , but they turned down my application for driver 's license test , since my visa status was still in an extension phase ."
3779,"Apart from that , since I also heard some bad rumors related to that DMV , I went tothe second nearest one from my apartment ."
3780,"In the second one , they accepted my application ."
3781,"I thought , maybe I should have come here in the first place ."
3782,"Because some rules are different from Japan , such as , it 's legal to turn right on a red light here , so I studied and prepared well for both of tests ."
3783,He was strong bald guy with sunglasses and never changed his facial expression or smiled .
3784,He reminded me of the Terminator - I hoped he would have said `` No problem `` .
3785,"When I was there , I was very surprised at many special products . I ca n't believe they can make it . I think they spent much time and money to make these hard work ."
3786,"I am a designer , too . At the beginning , I ca n't do those products . But I will make more effort , I believe I can do it in the future ."
3787,"I was very tired today , because I began working in the office after a 9 - day holiday ."
3788,"For the whole holiday , I sat up too late and got up too late ."
3789,So I must readjust to my old schedule .
3790,"By the way , in Japan , old people like to work without any specific reason ."
3791,It 's rainy today .
3792,I ate instant noodles because I did n't want to go out to buy lunch .
3793,I can buy some food from them .
3794,But it 's convenient especially during rainy days .
3795,So it became rusty . Furthermore it 's leaking water .
3796,And I rubbed off the rust with sand paper .
3797,I and four Spanish girls went to Hyde park for a picnic .
3798,One Spanish girl is leaving for London next week so I made Sushi for her .
3799,She said she liked my Sushi .
3800,"We had some stuffs , drank too much and smoke ."
3801,We enjoyed today .
3802,"My listening range is wildfrom pop , rap , rock , to Jazz and classic ."
3803,Thanks to the internet .
3804,"Due to the abundant kinds , I will introduce them in the"
3805,"First of all , we will talk about Taiwan 's pop music"
3806,Here I will list the famous singers in Taiwan for you
3807,"First one is Jay chou , I will say Jay is the pop king in Asia now ."
3808,He almost composes each song by himself in his albums and writes music for a bunch of Asia 's singers .
3809,His music always gets good praise and great selling records .
3810,"the second one is Jolin , Most of her music style is close to the fast dance music ."
3811,That one brings people joy and good spirit genre .
3812,"What is the best , almost her published albums will create a new dance style and lead to the fashion among the young people ."
3813,I will introduce the rest of the artists next time .
3814,I did n't know about this band until about 1 month ago .
3815,"My girlfriend recommended that I listen this band 's songs , and then I came to be into them ."
3816,"Their sound , voices and lyrics are so good ."
3817,Here are two songs from that album .
3818,Golden Week
3819,"Students , and others as well , are very happy because they have a lot of free time for play and going around to the places they wanted to go ."
3820,"Even though many were happy there are also those who were not , and that was me ."
3821,My field of work does n't have these privileges .
3822,teachers ' day
3823,Korea has many special days in May .
3824,Today is teachers ' day .
3825,it falls on May 15th .
3826,students nomally buy [ CROSS OUT ] conations [ / CROSS OUTcarnations and gifts and
3827,visit their teachers .
3828,I also visited my math professor and philosophy professor .
3829,"They both welcomed me ,"
3830,Please listen to my introduction ! !
3831,My name is Yuki .
3832,I 'm nineteen years old . ( 19 )
3833,I 'm a second year college student .
3834,I have been a member of soft tennis club for six years .
3835,"Of course , I like soft tennis the most ."
3836,"But , I like vollyball , basketball and so on ."
3837,I often see Japanese movies .
3838,I do n't watch foreign movies at all .
3839,My dream is to work in travel company .
3840,"First of all , I want to study about Japanese tourist attractions ."
3841,Thank you for reading .
3842,I have n't felt well since yesterday .
3843,So I stayed in bed all day .
3844,I think I 've caught a cold .
3845,I have been very busy lately .
3846,I have a Korean friend .
3847,He speaks Japanese very well .
3848,I think he is very cute ^ ^
3849,But he is younger than me . . .
3850,And I thought Korean men did n't chat .
3851,I am interested in Korean .
3852,"Oh , I have a runny nose . . ."
3853,I cooked stir - fried vegetables with chicken today .
3854,I grilled the / some chicken and seasoned it with sweet sake .
3855,"Then , I stir - fried it with some vegetables ."
3856,I am very happy when I can cook well .
3857,Let me introduce myself . .
3858,Hello . my name is Masha I am 18 years old .
3859,I 'm busy because I have to finish several reports and a midterm report for my thesis .
3860,"Plus , I have exams . . ."
3861,I 'm practically dying . . .
3862,"But after these busy days are over , I have two months of Spring vacation ! !"
3863,"I will work at school , but most of the time I will be free ."
3864,"I am planning to travel , shop , read whatever book I want , watch movies , and see my friends ."
3865,By chance I was born as a Japanese woman . . .
3866,people can go abroad or communicate on the internet more easily than ever .
3867,"However , as everyone knows , there still are so many people who are in extreme poverty . . ."
3868,"In other words , only a small percentage of people can own personal computers and communicate with people all over the world ."
3869,"And actually , this fact is quite strange for me . . ."
3870,The difference between rich and poor is based mostly just on which country they were born in !
3871,"I was born as a Japanese , but if I had been born in a poor nation , my life would have changed completely ."
3872,"But I know there is no `` if `` in human life , we ca n't do anything but live our own lives . . ."
3873,"As someone said , `` Do n't think too much about things that ca n't be changed . ``"
3874,Oh I just ca n't help but fall in love with this fantastic world .
3875,I live on a small island country and it seems not too many people share my enthusiasm about star trek stuff .
3876,The latest Star Trek movie is about captain Kirk and Spock .
3877,But it 's totally worth it . . . . .
3878,The city I live in has a warm climate .
3879,But these days the weather is getting cold rapidly .
3880,Many people prefer being warm rather than cold and I consider myself the most resolute one among them .
3881,"In these cold days , I just want to stay at home : home and dry , is there anything better than that ?"
3882,"Unfortunately , I caught a cold last night ."
3883,"Headache , nose clogged and cough , I hate them ! ! ! !"
3884,Maybe I will be healed after a sweaty dream . ( recover )
3885,"Today , I went swimming and ate ice cream after work ."
3886,I swam too hard / too much so I was exhausted .
3887,It 's quite funny .
3888,This menko card ' Harm of Building ' is assumed to have been printed in the 1930 's .
3889,"I can distinguish the printed era by the quality of the paper , printing and themes ."
3890,"First , it 's very difficut to find menko cards printed in multi - color in the 1920 's or earlier ."
3891,"Second , this could n't be in early 1940 's because themes that have nothing to do with the military could n't be allowed during WWII ."
3892,This could n't be in the later 1940 's because the quality of the paper and printing of this menko card is too good for that era .
3893,"Third , are there possibilities that it was printed in the 1950 's or later ?"
3894,Buildings were not an icon at that time .
3895,Boys love something special in all of the times .
3896,"So , I conluded this menko ' Harm of Building ' was printed in the 1930 's ."
3897,"In these days , kids ca n't have these kind of ' dystopia ' toys ."
3898,That 's the reason why I love menko !
3899,It was a rainy day .
3900,We shared an umbrella .
3901,We had launch at a famous restaurant .
3902,This restaurant is famous for `` handmade knife - cut noodles `` which contain short - necked clams and a variety of vegetables .
3903,It exhibited a lot of relics and information about seoul history .
3904,"Around evening time , we went to the ' Shinchon ' ."
3905,' Shinchon ' is known as the `` street of youth `` .
3906,There are many youthful people .
3907,We were one of them .
3908,We had dinner .
3909,We ate food made from flour .
3910,After we were full we took a walk .
3911,I am in Los Angeles .
3912,"Now , it is 7 : 37 am ."
3913,Good morning everybody !
3914,"Now , there are many cars on the freeway of Los Angeles ."
3915,I will go to San Francisco today .
3916,The athletic meeting at my son 's kidergarten is going to be held next week .
3917,He did n't take part in the event because of the influenza disease last year .
3918,"Today , I met a foreign guest , he always go to shopping at morning !"
3919,"So I very inquisitive to ask to him , are you a student ?"
3920,He said he is n't .
3921,He came here for Learning boxing .
3922,That 's so cool ! ! boxing ! !
3923,"It does not means I dislike them , I 'm just not interested in the contents they talk about ."
3924,"Hence , I feel bored , when I hang out with them ."
3925,I enjoyed the time when I was in the English conversation club .
3926,"It not only improves my speaking , but also helps me absorbs some culture about the United States ."
3927,All of them require a great deal of time .
3928,Long time no see .
3929,I did n't post any journal last semester .
3930,"My summer holiday will end next Monday , so I need to go back to school ."
3931,( I was very disappointed that my last diary had no comments .
3932,"Therefore for the time being , I would like to keep my practice to an english diary . )"
3933,"Today , I would like to talk about my anger to my manager in work place ."
3934,"I work for an export and import company , and I have been working in an office for 3 years ."
3935,And he has been working there around 13years .
3936,"Our company used to have members of 9 people , but now we consist of only 3 members"
3937,I was noticing my manager 's stupidity and he gives me a lecture and says that I ca n't be such a stupid person when I am a senior in the future .
3938,And I thought we could n't see his ability before due since it had been covered up to other people .
3939,He likes to shift his work responsibility to someone else .
3940,He ca n't decide anything and he always needs to make the way of his escape from any situation .
3941,He always pretends that I know everything .
3942,He used to speak negatively even when we were talking about jokes .
3943,I am not great but his attitude is disgustting to work with . I just need to talk to ease the stress .
3944,Someone told me that it will help to have good english speaking skills when you fight someone .
3945,Congratulations on Your Graduation !
3946,I changed my clothes to attend the ( more specific ) ceremony .
3947,"On my way to school , the rain changed into driving snow ."
3948,All graduates entered the high school assembly hall and they sat down in their seats .
3949,The most impressive thing was that girl 's graduate 's message to all students .
3950,The graduate 's parents were listening to her story with tears in their eyes .
3951,She said she had belonged to a volleyball club .
3952,"Finally , they could take part in the volleyball games and they experienced victories and defeats ."
3953,I believe it 's experience was a great treasure and she 'll never forget her wonderful memory for the rest of her life .
3954,My daughter also had great treasures and memories .
3955,Start Lang - 8
3956,Nice to meet you !
3957,"I 'm going to study in a language school in U , S , A ."
3958,Please teach me !
3959,An India visa
3960,Today I applied to the consulate for a visa for India .
3961,I have been in Changchun for several days .
3962,I saw a brown adult snake which had died beside a big banana field .
3963,Dad told me it was not poisonous because its head was n't triangle - shaped .
3964,That reminded me when of when I was a kid . . .
3965,It has been a long time since I first saw a snake .
3966,"I still remember when I was a elementary student , I saw a dead Umbrella snake [ Bungarus multicinctus , ( Blyth ) ] ."
3967,"That 's the first time I was so close to a poisonous snake , although it had already died ."
3968,My dad also told me lots of his experiences with snakes .
3969,"When he was a kid , he used to catch snakes regularly ."
3970,"If the snake was poisonous , he would hit until it was dead and play with it for fun ."
3971,"Or he might catch a non - poisonous snake , kill it and eat it ."
3972,"He said he brought a non - poisonous snake to school , the snake is really big . He was caught by his teacher , which resulted in him being severely beaten by his teacher ."
3973,"I asked him why he did that ,"
3974,"and he said , when he was a kid he was never afraid , and did everything for fun ."
3975,"But , he is a man now , and he would never do those things again ."
3976,I guess that 's because I learned one thing from this experience :
3977,"When people grow up , they gradually forget their instincts , or they become afraid of trying new things ."
3978,Rainy Season .
3979,Rainy season has finished yesterday in Japan .
3980,"I often used moter cycle , but therain has prevent me to ride ."
3981,"My English skills are poor , so whoever contacts me if you could please help me with my English , that 'd be great ! ( ^ _ ^ ) /"
3982,One of my favorite animes is `` Detroit Metal City ``
3983,"Detroit Metal City ( DMC ) is story about a musician , Negishi ."
3984,"But after all , he 's singing in death metal band , Detroit Metal City ."

4139,Students in public schools have studied English since 7th grade in Japan .
4140,"( But my Korean is not good , I ' mstill a beginner level . )"
4141,Most Japanese colleges let their students study any foreign language except English .
4142,We have to take other language classes . )
4143,"I wanted to study Korean at my college . But unfortunately , my college does n't offer Korean classes , so I took French ."
4144,"Actually , I do n't like to study French because I 'm not very interested in France to begin with . I took it against my will because I had to choose one my college offered ."
4145,"I 'm not fluent in any languages , but I 'm interested in other languages"
4146,Have you ever had this feeling too ? ( sounds more natural )
4147,"My mom said it 's not good for me , and she suggested that I should study other languages before I master one ."
4148,"I indeed agree with my mom , but how do I deal with my desires ?"
4149,What do you think about this issue ?
4150,"If you are okay with it , please answer my questions ."
4151,"Probably , most Japanese students are taught that sometimes `` were `` is used for the subjunctive mood ."
4152,"If I were rich , I could buy whatever I wanted ."
4153,However my teacher told me that most Americans do n't use it .
4154,I think that all languages are changeable every minute but I 'm confused .
4155,Do you use `` were `` for the subjunctive mood ?
4156,I hate examinations .
4157,"When I was a child , I was very good at it ."

4176,I watched some movies .
4177,Today was a holiday .
4178,"So , I went to the movie theater to watch some movies ."
4179,"I watched two movies ; because , today is first day that we can watch movies for only 1000 yen ."
4180,We usually have to pay about 2000 yen .
4181,I watched the Japanese movies `` My Darling is a Foreigner ' ' and `` Nodame cantarbire . ' ' Those movies were funny and impressive .
4182,`` Nodame cantabire ' ' is one of my favorite movies .
4183,It 's theme is music
4184,and setting is in Paris .
4185,I recommend it .

4189,"Whatever you choose , Carnival is a time to recharge your batteries in order to face the year ahead ."
4190,Is it possible to understand other people 's pain ?
4191,I think we can imagine other people 's pain because of our past experiences .
4192,"For example , we know that it 's painful when a ball hits to my body quickly ."
4193,Because we learn that by experiencing that .
4194,"So when a ball hits other people 's body , I can imagine that it is painful ."
4195,But I can only imagine that .
4196,A ball did n't hit my body .
4197,A ball hitting other people 's body is not my experience .
4198,So I ca n't understand .
4199,How do you answer this question ?
4200,The garbage was collected this morning .

4205,I did n't know what was I supposed to say to her .
4206,I did n't come up with any words that could make her feel better .
4207,"After the class was over , I got a call from my Japanese friend ."
4208,Her boy friend who she started dating only 3 days ago dumped her .
4209,Probably saying nothing and listening to her talk was the best way to make her feel better .
4210,It is sometimes really hard for me to think of what I should say when my friends are having a hard time .
4211,Then I also looked up ' middling ' and could n't really see a difference between the two definitions
4212,I was laughed class mate . My classmate laughed at me
4213,But I decided to act rather than keep confusing myself .
4214,Today I went shopping with my mother and brother .
4215,My mother had come back after some months . She works in another city and visits us once every two or three months .
4216,"It is winter here , and my brother did n't take his coat because that morning it was sunny ."
4217,He should have taken his coat .
4218,It 's took place one day during my childhood .
4219,"When I was a student in middle school , Though I had seen my friend 's father once in the bus , but I could n't recognize him ."
4220,So I did n't bow to him .
4221,A few days later my friend who is a daughter of the man that I saw in the bus asked me why I did n't bow to her father ?
4222,I was wondering I said `` I 've never seen your father `` .
4223,`` My father said he saw you in the bus on that day . `` she replied
4224,I wish for your attention ~
4225,She sent me a text to say that she would be late .
4226,Since I have to make some progress in my English writing skills .

4239,"With this kind of life style , my fatigue accumulates day by day ."
4240,"In conclusion , I will take a rest during my summer vacation , and recover my vigor ."
4241,"I usually use excel at work ,"

4248,"I 'm a boy , I 'm 21 , and I 'm from China ."
4249,I want to make some friends with this !
4250,It has been about 4 months since my last checkup .
4251,The dentist told me that I do n't have any cavities as yet .
4252,"I sometimes forget or fail to brush my teeth , but fortunately I have had no cavities since I began going there and I get my tartar removed on a regular basis ."
4253,The dentist and assistants always manageto find a way to relax children .
4254,"For example , they put a TV in front of the patient 's chair and play the DVD of ' Tom & Jerry ' while the child is ( being ) examined ."
4255,I 'm afraid that the parents confuse Tom 's shriek with their child 's . lol !
4256,"I heard an ambulance siren , but the siren stopped soon ."
4257,I went outside and saw the ambulance stopped at the condominium near here .
4258,"After a while , ( maybe in 20 minutes ) , I went outside again and noticed the ambulance was still there ."

4265,There were 5 different couples getting married .

4267,"Then , yesterday I went to Shiga to help out with a choral society 's regular concert ."
4268,I felt a little tense when I read the congratulatory messege .
4269,"since I was busy 2 days , I went to a `` sento `` ( Public bath ) today !"
4270,I feel so relaxed .
4271,I think `` sento `` is a nice part of Japanese culture .
4272,I returned to my home .
4273,I went to Thailand 6 days ago and I arrived in South Korea yesterday .
4274,"When I arrived in Thailand , I could not breath because the temperature was over 40C , but I had a precious time in Thailand ."
4275,I could feel that Thai people are very kind and have a positive mind .
4276,"There were several beautiful places and many delicious foods , which were very economical ."
4277,"Sometimes I got into a ' Tuk Tuk ' , which is a Thai transportation ."
4278,"It shook heavily , but it was very fun . The Thai 's McDonald mascot had a different pose from other countries ."
4279,I had a great time in Thailand and I will never forget my trip .

4290,"When I looked at it , I was so shocked because it was the bowl which our dog had used before ."
4291,"Of course , my daughter was upset , and could n't understand what she meant ."
4292,Therefore she started to explain about the bowl `` It was the bowl which you used when were my dog . I have wanted to meet you as a human being for a long time .
4293,Do n't you remember that bowl ? ``

4296,"When I was in Okinawa , I could see the clouds differently ."
4297,They looked like they were raised in the sky .
4298,The sparsely raised clouds in the sky amplified the uncanny atmosphere with twinkling stars .
4299,It seems to me that nature there was different from that of big cities such as Tokyo .
4300,Therefore our eyes were naturally riveted on its indigenous nature .
4301,"Even after soaking in the sea , the sunbeam promptly evaporated the water from our soggy clothes ."
4302,And its original culture enriches harmony between human and nature .
4303,Okinawa has some remote isles around it .
4304,And I found myself looking at a carriage towed by a water buffalo at one of the isles .

4331,"After another short while , the master living on the street came in and said , `` Excuse me ."
4332,I have things to discuss with your master . ``
4333,"I 'm so excited and also nervous today , because this is the first time that I logged on to Lang - 8 , and that is why I 'm nervous . My English is not very good I ca n't speak with a foreigner and I ca n't even speak with my classmates ."
4334,The purpose of applying for this account is because I want to improve my English and I want to make more friends with people from all over the world .
4335,I know there are many differences between the eastern and the western culture . I also want to learn about it .
4336,"So , I hope you can help me , and I 'll be very happy if I can be your friend ."
4337,"Ah . I like humman b - box very much . If someone who has the same hobby as I have , we can communicate with each other ."
4338,I am very thankful to Lang - 8 for giving us a communicaton platform .
4339,Are they dead or alive ?
4340,Osama bin Laden
4341,I 'm taking night classes after work in a public school .
4342,"For now , I enrolled for the next three months ."
4343,"After this session , I 'll consider whether I should keep up with the class or not ."
4344,The class is OK so far ; it 's not difficult .
4345,"I went to a temple today with my friend , Dora ."
4346,Both of us got really bad fortunes .
4347,"Although I told her `` Just forget about it , it does n't matter `` ,"
4348,"I asked about both love and study ,"
4349,and the fortune said `` Do n't go forward . . .
4350,That 's really awkward .
4351,I ca n't hate my cousin no matter what happens .
4352,"A few months ago , I got an idea about how to bring my cousin here ."
4353,"You know , speaking English is also important in Korea ."
4354,"Actually , we do n't speak English in our country ."
4355,"But , when we try to get a job , we will be tested in English ."
4356,"Anyway , when he first came here he had n't got his own car , so he used to borrow my car ."
4357,Sometimes he wanted to drive my car when we went somewhere together .
4358,He nearly killed me three times .
4359,"For example , when we were on the highway , he was driving at 110km ."
4360,"But he did n't watch the road , as he was interested in some cows which were on the side of the highway ."
4361,He crossed the middle line .
4362,"At that time , a car was coming in the opposite lane ."
4363,"But , he did n't know that until I screamed out ."
4364,It was too dangerous .
4365,There are even more stories I can tell .
4366,I think I have already said too much .
4367,We will talk about this again later .
4368,Our middle daughter was crying when we tried to put her in bed yesterday .
4369,"Either my wife or I need to take care of our youngest daughter , so she sometimes has to sleep alone ."
4370,"While she was crying , I just finished putting our youngest daughter to bed then I took care of her ."
4371,I will present a solution for a problem in the textbook !
4372,"However , the problem is difficult for me !"
4373,"Recently , I 've been worriedabout what I want to do in my future , so I am depressed and have been just concentrating on studying !"
4374,My present worry is about what kind of jobs are suitable for me .
4375,"I noticed recently that I do n't like studying alone , so being a researcher or professor seems unsuitable for me ."
4376,So I will work in a big name maker ( large company ? ) and make plans for new products .
4377,Or maybe I will work in a bank because I have a skill for math and could use it .
4378,"However I have much time to make a decision , so I have focus what I have to do now ."
4379,Time is running out !
4380,So I will try my best to do what I can do now !
4381,I am a unviersity student . I am 21 years old . I want to practice my English .
4382,So anyone who wants to learn Chinese or can help me in my English may add ICQ number 437346934 or my MSN merny _ ting @ hotmail . com . Thanks ~
4383,Almost all People said `` It 's very useful and exquisite ! ``
4384,So I will exert effort in order to understand it .
4385,My fasebook journey starts today .
4386,"I 'll be a college student after this summer holiday , which make me excited , full of pride and hopeful / hope ."
4387,College life is also preparation for future careers .
4388,"Although there are people who attend college just to fulfill their parents ' wish and get the diploma , I think that wasting time in college to play computer and so on is not a smart idea ."
4389,Learning and practicing the skills which we will need in the future is essential
4390,"All of us wanna have a happy life and a good career with high income , so most of us want to attend to college to realize our dream ."
4391,Therefore we should grasp every second in college .
4392,"First , I 'm sorry for my poor English ."
4393,We have been given huge support by many countries .
4394,Thank you so much for your warm - heartedness ! !
4395,"I love you , friends ! !"
4396,Fortunately I did n't feel the huge shaking .
4397,Keep going ~ ! ! ! Keep going ~ ~ ! ! !
4398,"Where there is a will , there is a way !"
4399,"From now on , I 've decided to memorize some English words every day ."
4400,I think that vocabulary is the base of English .
4401,"I had been studying English at school in Japan since I was in junior - high school until now , in university , but I still ca n't speak English fluently ."
4402,"It has been said that Japanese education 's serious problem for a long time , and it was made by English teachers ."
4403,"Because most of Japanese school 's English teachers ca n't speak English fluently , they ca n't teach English like a native speaker ."
4404,"Of course they have good teaching skill , but I think the most important aspect of English education is how to communicate , because language is tool communication ."
4405,"Even though Japanese students have been studying English for 6 or 10 years is school , they ca n't form good relationships with foreigners for the lack of speaking skill ."
4406,The Japanese government has been encouraged to improve English teacher 's training for decade .
4407,"The ministry of education have been trying to employ foreigner English teachers instead of Japanese teachers for raise a English education 's quality , otherwise it was hardly functional in Japan ."
4408,I went to the beauty salon to change my hair color .
4409,My hair became bright and I like my new color .
4410,"But all my friends , even my family"
4411,I have a part time job at a supermarket .
4412,"Yesterday , I got a higher salary than I expected ."
4413,It makes me happy but I want to earn more money .
4414,I want to travel to Australia to see my friend .
4415,I want to go abroad !
4416,I have a muscle ache since I went on a 10km jog yesterday .
4417,I should n't have tried overdoing it : - (
4418,Yesterday 's weather was cloudy and snowy .
4419,I went to a cafe with my frend .
4420,I ate a delicious cake and drank tea .
4421,The U .
4422,S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Japan lately .
4423,"While I was watching the news piece , I noticed a certain thing ."
4424,"I know , of course , that she was trying to speak clearly and slowly so the audience could comprehend what she meant or wanted to say . . ."
4425,Her speech may be a good substitute for a text book to improve our listening skills
4426,"This is the third time I 've writen : ) As the title says , today is my birthday and I am 21 !"
4427,"Anyway , my friend gave me pieces of cake and a message card for me ."
4428,The card said that keep good friendship between us and she hopes I will have a good day .
4429,I swear to myself that I will also make her happy in her birthday as well .
4430,I 've lived in Tokyo for a long time .
4431,"I have a question , if you went to Tokyo , where would you recommend to go ?"
4432,I 'm very tired and sleepy cuz I only slept 3hours last night .
4433,I just finished class and the next lesson will start in 4hours .
4434,I may sleep until the class starts but I have to study traffic rules to pass the exam . . . . .
4435,recently there has n't been any change in my life .
4436,"I want to go drinking , dancing , play tennis and many other things ."
4437,moving is troublesome for me .
4438,but it seems fun to live in a place where I 've never been .
4439,"anyway , I have many things I have to do ."
4440,first of all I will try to go to bed .
4441,Today was an extremely nice day .
4442,There was sunshine and the weather was like spring .
4443,I really wanted to hang out with my friends but I didn ' t
4444,"Because yesterday when I was playing baseball with my baseball team ,"
4445,I hit my face against the other team 's player .
4446,"I was really hurt ,"
4447,and I got a black eye .
4448,I did n't want to show my face to other people .
4449,So I was studyig English and watching `` LOST `` ( American Drama ) in my home .
4450,"Despite the fact that I did n't hang out with my friends , I was happy"
4451,I was so nervous from start to finish that my face was ( or became ) drenched with perspiration ( I must 've looked uglier than usual . . . ) and some questions I had prepared for the interview slipped my mind .
4452,"On my way home , I was already beginning to give up on the job and decided to go to the Employment Service Agency tomorrow ."
4453,"Although what I desperately want now is a full - time job , I opted to accept the offer right away ."
4454,"After all , I need to make a living ."
4455,"Anyway , after working part - time for a two month period of probation , the company will see if I 'm suitable for the position ."
4456,"So , from now on , I have to learn a lot of technical terms for clothing to translate the company 's web site and documents and so forth into English ."
4457,Could anybody tell me any helpful web sites to learn about these terms ?
4458,my trouble with learning English
4459,"With my spare time , I have been studying english at an international english school since Dec , 2007 ."
4460,"but to my disappointment , I have found that I have not made any obvious progress , especially with my listening and oral skills ."
4461,"although I can read some english articles and write some simple e - mails in english now , it is still very difficult for me to communicate with foreigners in english ."
4462,howcan I improve my english listening level in a shortamount of time ?
4463,who would like to give me some useful advice ?
4464,"Today , when I were surfing internet , I found this journal ."
4465,I am going to translate it . ( more natural )
4466,He graduated from the high school which I graduated from .
4467,"In the Southern Kanto , there were only two DPJ statesmen who could retain their seats in constituencies , Kan Naoto of Musashino City of Tokyo and Noda Yoshihiko of Funabashi City of Chiba ."
4468,This is the reason why he was considered as a new leader of DPJ .
4469,My nearest railway station located on the border of Funabashi and Narashino Cities .
4470,"Many statesman frequently appears there , and Noda often speaks to voters at the station in the morning ."
4471,"I have always voted for him in elections , but I know nothing about his policies , because he says nothing about them ."
4472,"He studied politics at a famous university , so he certainly has a lot of policies ."
4473,"However , he does n't show his policies clearly to the voters , because policies make enemies ."
4474,"He is eager to help voters , but obviously , he does n't like talk about ideological matters ."
4475,13-May
4476,I went to my English class .
4477,Our company held a get - together today .
4478,We ate pork ribs .
4479,They were delicious .
4480,Now I am going to sleep .
4481,I just joined Lang - 8
4482,I just joined Lang 8 XD
4483,I do n't know what to write here .
4484,But I 'm trying .
4485,"Everybody , please help me ."
4486,I wish Winter would come faster . . ^ ^
4487,Last year I started learning snow boarding .
4488,It was the first time in my life to go to a skiing ground .
4489,"At first I just skiied , but 2 hours passed and I became uninterested ."
4490,Changing to a snow board was really fantastic .
4491,"Taking a ski lesson for 1hour was o . k , but snowboarding was ( both ) very , very difficult and very interesting ."
4492,For the first time I bought equipment .
4493,"The weather has been so hot that I really miss winter ,"
4494,when everything becomes white .
4495,It was not so common here in Japan to change jobs about 20 years ago .
4496,My first job - change was at that time .
4497,"However , to tell the truth , I wanted an easy way to escape from difficult problems ."
4498,"When I had to face such problems , I strongly felt that it was a waste of time to keep trying ."
4499,I 'm apt to hope that great results would come .
4500,But great achievements are not ( often ) obtained easily .
4501,"If someone 's success is shining brightly , I can just see it ."
4502,"It sounds like a simple thing , but it 's difficult for me ."
4503,"When I think that solving a difficult problem will be impossible , it will probably turn out to be true ."
4504,I should quit worrying about whether or not I might fail and just keep on doing it once if I have started .
4505,"Some hold the view that it is not needed to increase teachers ' salaries in order to improve the quality of education , because they firmly believe that a major part of students ' education is the students themselves ."
4506,"However , from my everyday experience and observation , I can state several factors to defend the statement that increasing teachers ' salaries can improve the quality of education ."
4507,"First , a well paid occupation can attract many people to be a teacher . It follows that many people with a doctorate are willing to be a professor in universities ."
4508,There is no doubt that a doctor has more sophisticated eucational skills than a graduate since he had more studies and teaching experiences .
4509,"For example , my school is just an average college , but it offers the teachers a high salary ."
4510,"In this case , the teachers inculding professors and teaching assistants mostly have a doctorate or two ."
4511,"And thus the quality of education in our university improve sharply , as well as our good reputation ."
4512,"Second , increasing the teacher 's salary can inspire them to do their best ."
4513,It is the same as a boss increasing an employee 's salary .
4514,"The teachers are the ones that want to keep their salary in a stable stuation , and must satisfy their students and the dean ."
4515,The need to prepare their course carefully and introduce new and interesting methods to educate students .
4516,"In a word , increasing the teachers ' salaries is the best way to improve the quality of education ."
4517,Because many qualified people will want to become teachers with a high salary and inspire them to do their best .
4518,I work for a baby cloth company as PR .
4519,I used to live in FL and LA as foreign student .
4520,"Recently or Nowadays , I do n't have chance to speak and write in English , so this will be good opportunity to keep the skill for me ."
4521,I hope everyone see this and correct this .
4522,"Most of Japanese domestic Companies have the five - day workweek system , and the holidays are Saturday and Sunday ."
4523,The good point is that everywhere I go are not so many people .
4524,"The Bad point , However , is that I have a work on Saturday ."
4525,"Most of my friends have day offs on Saturday and Sunday ,"
4526,"If you live in an Asian countries , it 's easier to take a trip to Korea than those who do n't live in Asia ."
4527,It 's actually been said that a trip to Korea is cheaper than a domestic one .
4528,"If you only want to enjoy nice Korean foods , you do not necessarily have to go to Korea ."
4529,Because there 's always been a so - called Korean town in Tokyo ! !
4530,"I went to Korean town and had a really nice Korean BBQ tonight with my colleagues , which reminded me of visiting Korea about two years ago !"
4531,"Yesterday , I was so tired and went to bed early ."
4532,But because a friend sent me an SMS telling me he was sick
4533,I was worried about him and could not sleep well .
4534,"Ah , hope that he will feel better soon ."
4535,"Yesterday , I read a Japanese comic book ( MANGA ) called `` GAKU `` ."
4536,It 's a story of a mountain rescue team member named Sanpo .
4537,He is a very strong climber who had climbed many famous mountains in the world .
4538,"Furthermore , he is known for his kindness ."
4539,Sanpo would never scold at careless climbers .
4540,"Instead , he would tell them `` You did your best ."
4541,Let 's come back to the mountains again once you 're cured ! ``
4542,I argue with my wife because we have some differences between us .
4543,I wish I could be like him .
4544,I 'd like to encourage my students in English when they do their homework .
4545,What can ( should ) I say to them ?
4546,I would be very happy if you could give me some ideas .
4547,"Those who do n't know this disease may feel frightened just to hear about it , but it 's one of the skin diseases that children often suffer from ."
4548,"This disease causes red rashes on the hands , feet , and mouth and even on the ass ."
4549,He got many rashes and has a high fever .
4550,"Now he 's getting better , but I feel really sorry to see my son 's body full of the rashes ."
4551,I studied English about 8 years ago .
4552,My favarite movie is `` The devil wears ( the ) PRADA ``
4553,"Tomorrow , I 'm going to have my hair cut ."
4554,Is this sentence correct ?
4555,The Performer was Robert Glasper Experiment .
4556,They are one of the most creative musicians these days . They make original music based on Jazz and HipHop .
4557,"I was really moved by their music , so I am looking forward to listening to their live music soon again ."
4558,"I learned about this website from one of my friends ,"
4559,"She used this to improve her japanese , and also made friends ."
4560,She told me that I can practice english here
4561,"My name is Una , I have trouble in english , and I really want to improve it ."
4562,"Correcting my poor english will takes you lots time , I hope you do n't mind ."
4563,It is true that hunting whales is japanese tradition .
4564,"Before seeing this movie , I would never feel like that because eating whale is japanese old custom and tradition like french eat rabbits and frogs , escargos ."
4565,Fishermen and their families are thankful for whales .
4566,And they prey for the whale and they have a festival for apprecaite to the whale .
4567,"It is not easy for everyone to kill ANY animal for eating , they hunt the whale with hard pain for their life , that is earning money ."
4568,They cover the blue seat above the sea not to show killing whales after the movie was broadcasted because they think the scene of dieing should not be shown like human being does n't show their face to all people when they die .
4569,Fishermen do n't break any international law .
4570,What right do Sea shepard have to criticize them personally .
4571,They should critisize the hunting to the whale in itself in right way .
4572,They just make fishermen angry by taking photos and videos with persistence and they get the scene fisherman is mad at them .
4573,It is definitely unfair .
4574,What do you think about hunting whales ? ?
4575,"In Japan , there lives quite a number of cockroaches ."
4576,They are so scary that even a sight of one makes me thrill .
4577,3years ago no less than 4 cockroaches appeared in my room at the same time .
4578,My skin became itchy and turned red .
4579,The insecticide was too strong .
4580,The things I like most
4581,I like risks and new things .
4582,New things always fascinate me .
4583,"I think every changes have the reasons and sometimes , the changes help me grow up ( matures ) ."
4584,I like risks because risk brings out the best in oneself .
4585,the life that you see is wonderful .
4586,This is the internet making it possible to integrate human intelligence all over the world .
4587,"However there are 2 people , those who post the information 's on the net and those who use the information on the net ."
4588,Myself included .
4589,So I wonder who will give the comment on this diary .
4590,My youngest daughter woke me up and asked me to take her down to the living room this morning .
4591,"I wanted to sleep more , but I decided not to go back to sleep and do some work ."
4592,There were many people there because it 's Higan in Japan .
4593,We ate a late lunch at a restaurant near the station .
4594,"As we got back home and I was entering our house , my youngest daughter wanted to play in the garden out the front ."
4595,So I weeded the garden while she was playing .
4596,"It was an ordinary day , but I still think it was a good one ."
4597,I went to the Guns and Roses concert at the Tokyo Dome last night .
4598,The sound system was messed up !
4599,"Probably , it was because of the area where I was seated ."
4600,I guess the speaker system could not reach our area ( very ) well .
4601,"In addition to that , it was too cold in the venue and so on . . ."
4602,"Anyway , I was happy to hear famous tunes from their past albums ."
4603,Today I joined an English school .
4604,Its the kind where students talk to a teacher living in Philippines by Skype phone ( IP telephone ) .
4605,Its costs 5000 yen .
4606,Its very cheap when compared to a normal English school .
4607,"I can hear the teacher 's voice clearly , but it is difficult to understand what the teacher says when its only by voice ."
4608,"I worked hard without much success , because the topic was too difficult and complicated to describe ."
4609,"The textbook quoted from a lot of papers , so I was really confused trying to make sense of the outline ."
4610,I was n't satisfied my presentation though I like drinking after every effort none the less ^ ^
4611,I want to do better next time .
4612,A huge job hunting event will be held this weekend at a large convention hall in Tokyo .
4613,So I made reservations for an overnight bus and hotel .
4614,"I was too late to make reservations , so it was very difficult to find them , especially an overnight bus ."
4615,"As for a hotel , I 'll stay at a hotel which has hot springs ."
4616,"However , I can stay there at a reasonable price ."
4617,I 'm looking forward to visiting there .
4618,I hope I 'll be motivated through this event .
4619,"Today , I could n't explain a British person why TOEIC is more famous than IELTS ."
4620,"I said `` TOEIC is the main examination in Japan , so many shops have got a lot of TOEIC text book , a only a few IELTS . ``"
4621,"I 've had difficulty , especially in writing because I have n't received proper feedback ."
4622,I also want to help people who wish to learn Korean .
4623,Hello ! Everybody !
4624,todayI wrote an introduction about myself ! ! !
4625,I live in japan .
4626,My job is aresident nurse in a hospital .
4627,my dream is to be aninternational nurse ! so I will try my best ! !
4628,please help me improve my english ! ! !
4629,"if you wanna study japanese , I can teach you japanese ! ! !"
4630,but I ca n't see the sea .
4631,I want to see the sea .
4632,"Now , Japan is in a critical situation ."
4633,I think spilling radioactive water to the sea is a catastrophe .
4634,"There might be no choice about that , but I ca n't understand why they did it ."
4635,"Maybe if they did n't , the power plant would have exploded ? ?"
4636,What is worse is that the Japanese government is trying to control information in this internet age .
4637,And I know many people are worrying about it .
4638,I really appreciate that .
4639,But I really want to know what foreign people are thinking about this situation in Japan .
4640,Chinese is so fun .
4641,"Japanese also uses Kanji , so I think it 's a little easier for Japanese people to remember Chinese words ."
4642,But it 's difficult to pronounce and to understand .
4643,"It takes a long time for me to remember English words , but I often already know the meaning of a Chinese word the moment I see it ."
4644,"Today after my Chinese class , my teacher asked me to come to his desk ."
4645,"I thought , `` Did I do something bad . . . ? ``"
4646,"But he said , `` You study so hard , but your pronunciation is a little incorrect , so I 'll teach you . ``"
4647,Sounds like you 've had a good time in Africa ! !
4648,I 'll send you a gift here and there if it makes you happy : D
4649,"You think I 'm so kind , do n't you ? ! !"
4650,Hope you 'll have brilliant experiences there ! !
4651,I find it a bit difficult to play futsal because a futsal court is narrow .
4652,That is why I have to learn skillful moves in which I 'm second to none .
4653,Let 's play futsal together ! !
4654,My 5 - month - old daughter finally learnt to turn herself over today !
4655,"She can turn onto to her right side and lie on her tummy , but she ca n't turn back the other way ."
4656,QingDao - My second home
4657,Right who gave me a family .
4658,Many people like it here because of the long Yellow Sea coastline .
4659,"When summer comes , the temperature does not increase much ."
4660,Now it is winter .
4661,It is very cold .
4662,The wind is very strong .
4663,I lost my umbrella yesterday .
4664,"It 's very bad news , because I am living in a rainy city ."
4665,I need a big umberella to avoid getting wet .
4666,"After a few days , I think I should go buy a new one ."
4667,Even though I still want my other umbrella back . . .
4668,My company 's client had the following requirements for the blog ;
4669,To make and embed a blurry picture on the website .
4670,To focus on some but not all parts of their hair salon .
4671,Basically I always listen to all the requests from a client and try my best to achieve the goal exactly the way the client imagines in her mind .
4672,"However , this time the client was very strict about the whole layout in detail , because they themselves take care of their own clients ' hair style everyday and are very specific about the image they are trying to portray on their website ."
4673,"It took us thee months to complete it and we , our designers , coders and I , have just finished making it . I felt a great sense of relieve when we finally completed it !"
4674,Cherry blossoms are surprising . . .

4712,How should I do the test and not fall asleep ?
4713,The only good news is that I might get a driver 's license as soon as next weekend .

4730,Eat at Home or Eat Out ?
4731,"I think your answer is `` Yes , of course . ``"
4732,It 's not easy to cook e complex dishes because cooking is a high technique job requires certain techniques .
4733,"I seldom invite my friends to eat at home . I am not confident in my cooking skills , although my friends would not mind , even if I only made noodles ."
4734,"Making a delicious food is a difficult . You need to know what kind of ingredients and tools , needed to prepare the recipe , and you need to know how to select , use , and cook these ingredients ."
4735,"In China , there are thousands of various ingredients l and cooking methods ."
4736,"Even if the material is the same , the taste may be variant from different vary by cooking method and chef ."
4737,"For example , fish can be cooked by frying , steaming , or salting , etc ."
4738,The side - dish could be any kind of vegetables or even traditional Chinese herbs .
4739,"So As you can see , it is not easy to cook such nice dishes at home . If you invite a friend for a meal , I suggest you go to a restaurant or a chophouse ."
4740,"As a second consideration option , most Chinese people invite friends to eat out when they hold celebrations , such as birthday parties or relationship building parties ."
4741,"In these situations , the host usually pays the bill . The custom is different from Western custom . ' ."
4742,"For this reason , doing this would be considered stingy , because you will spend less money , or and the next time your friends invite you to a restaurant , you will feel like you owe them something ."
4743,"Finally , eating out can be considered convenient and saves more time to chat or do other things ."
4744,"Eating out could take less than one third of the time that eating at home takes . That is , if taking it takes twenty minutes to eat at a restaurant , it would take one hour at home ."
4745,Eating out means there is no need to wash dishes and cleaning work or clean after a meal .
4746,"Especially when you invite a lot of people for a meal , eating at home would be too much work ."
4747,It was such a huge so much work that I remember it even now .
4748,"Now , in my hometown , many such parties would be held in restaurant for convenience ."
4749,"There are many reasons to support my view that eating out is better than eating at home , especially when you inviting friends for a meal ."
